Based on the detailed reading of the study on the relapse of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) after conservative treatment, I can provide a comprehensive list of potential research impacts. These impacts are aligned with the dimensions from the research documents provided and supported by the contents of the study.

Potential Research Impacts
1. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
Impact: The study provides evidence that supports the long-term use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) as an effective treatment for preventing EH relapse. This will lead to changes in clinical guidelines for managing EH, improving patient care and reducing the need for invasive procedures like hysterectomy.
Relevance: Improved clinical outcomes for women diagnosed with EH, with a focus on fertility preservation and reducing progression to cancer.

2. Health and Well-Being Impact
Impact: The findings can directly contribute to the long-term health and well-being of women at risk of endometrial cancer. By reducing relapse rates and providing a non-invasive treatment option, the study promotes better health outcomes and potentially extends life expectancy.
Relevance: Preventing the progression from hyperplasia to carcinoma could significantly reduce cancer incidence and mortality rates in women.

3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Impact: The study could inform national and international guidelines for the treatment of EH, emphasizing long-term follow-up to prevent relapse. This could influence public health policies regarding women’s reproductive health and cancer prevention strategies.
Relevance: Policymakers in healthcare systems could use this evidence to adjust guidelines for EH treatment, promoting non-invasive management strategies to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes.

10. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Impact: The use of LNG-IUS is a sustainable approach to treating EH as it reduces the need for resource-intensive surgical interventions. It also supports ethical considerations by providing women with non-invasive options that preserve fertility.
Relevance: Aligning with sustainable healthcare practices, this research encourages the use of long-term, low-cost treatments that reduce environmental impact and healthcare resource consumption.

11. Public Awareness and Education
Impact: The study can increase public awareness about the risks associated with EH and the importance of early diagnosis and long-term follow-up. Public health campaigns could use the findings to inform women about available treatments, improving health literacy in reproductive health.
Relevance: Promoting education around the prevention of endometrial cancer and the benefits of non-surgical treatments can lead to better-informed healthcare decisions among women.
References: Research Impact Toolkit​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Capacity Building and Training
Impact: Through the dissemination of findings in medical conferences and publications, the study can contribute to capacity building within the healthcare community, particularly in training practitioners to implement new treatment protocols for EH.
Relevance: Developing healthcare provider expertise in conservative treatment options for EH ensures improved patient care and promotes continuing professional development.
