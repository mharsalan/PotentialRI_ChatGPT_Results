To assess the research impact dimensions of the attached study, "Oral Progestogens vs Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System for Endometrial Hyperplasia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis," here is the breakdown based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study primarily impacts the health domain by comparing the effectiveness of oral progestogens and the Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) in treating endometrial hyperplasia, a condition that can progress to cancer if untreated. The findings indicate that the LNG-IUS achieves a higher regression rate for both complex and atypical hyperplasia compared to oral progestogens (Results, Page 547.e2).
Example: The research contributes to healthcare practices by providing evidence that LNG-IUS is more effective than oral progestogens for certain forms of endometrial hyperplasia, influencing clinical decisions for non-surgical management of the condition.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study's impact is likely to have long-term effects by informing future treatment guidelines and protocols for endometrial hyperplasia, influencing patient care for years to come. As stated, “The Birmingham Women’s Hospital Research and Development Department provided financial support” (Acknowledgments), suggesting institutional backing that supports the longevity of this research (Page 547.e1).
Example: The findings could lead to long-term shifts in treatment approaches, potentially reducing the number of hysterectomies performed for hyperplasia and thus decreasing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes over time.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The stakeholders include gynecologists, healthcare providers, and policymakers. The study directly impacts clinical practitioners by providing clearer evidence for treatment decisions (Methods, Page 547.e3).
Example: Gynecologists will directly benefit from the results by applying more effective treatment methods for their patients with endometrial hyperplasia. Indirect stakeholders include patients who benefit from better treatment outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has deep impact within the field of gynecology and reproductive health by offering critical data on treatment effectiveness. It could also have broad impact on healthcare cost management by potentially reducing the need for invasive surgeries like hysterectomies (Results, Page 547.e2).
Example: The research is deeply impactful in advancing treatment for a specific condition (endometrial hyperplasia) while also having broader implications for women's health policy and practice globally.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings are scalable as they can influence treatment protocols globally, especially in regions with high rates of endometrial hyperplasia or limited access to surgical interventions (Results, Page 547.e4).
Example: The treatment recommendations can be transferred to various healthcare settings, from low-resource clinics to advanced medical centers, making the results applicable on a wider scale.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative findings by providing a robust comparison of treatment options for endometrial hyperplasia, emphasizing non-surgical interventions like LNG-IUS, which is more effective than traditional oral progestogens for certain cases (Conclusion, Page 547.e4).
Example: By promoting LNG-IUS as a superior treatment, the study may disrupt current treatment preferences, leading to more widespread adoption of this method in place of oral progestogens.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study supports sustainability in healthcare by advocating for treatment options that minimize the need for invasive surgeries, thus reducing healthcare costs and improving patient quality of life (Introduction, Page 547.e2).
Example: It presents an ethical dimension by promoting treatments that reduce patient morbidity associated with more invasive procedures, ensuring more humane and sustainable care approaches for women with hyperplasia.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study findings are highly implementable, as they provide clear clinical guidelines for using LNG-IUS in the management of endometrial hyperplasia (Results, Page 547.e3).
Example: Healthcare providers can easily integrate the use of LNG-IUS into treatment protocols for women at risk of developing endometrial cancer, improving usability in everyday clinical practice.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While the study is focused on gynecology, its implications cross into public health and oncology by addressing cancer prevention strategies (Methods, Page 547.e3).
Example: The research is globally relevant as endometrial hyperplasia affects women worldwide, and the findings can influence international health policies regarding women's reproductive health.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study's recommendations show resilience, as they suggest a treatment approach adaptable to various healthcare settings, including those with limited surgical options (Discussion, Page 547.e4).
Example: LNG-IUS, as a non-surgical solution, can be adapted in both high- and low-resource settings, making it a resilient choice for treating hyperplasia under different healthcare conditions.
