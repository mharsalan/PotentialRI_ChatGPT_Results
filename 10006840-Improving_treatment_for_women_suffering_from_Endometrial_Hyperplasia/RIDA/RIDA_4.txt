To assess the research paper you uploaded based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I have extracted relevant details as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"BMI 35 or higher is strongly associated with relapse of complex nonatypical hyperplasia after initial regression with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system treatment." This directly impacts the health domain by informing treatment strategies and follow-up protocols for endometrial hyperplasia (Discussion, p. 1168).
Example: This research impacts the healthcare domain by influencing treatment protocols for women with endometrial hyperplasia, particularly emphasizing the role of BMI in predicting relapse, which can guide clinical decision-making.

2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"Long-term follow-up allows the accurate estimation of the predictive ability of clinical characteristics to predict regression or relapse." (Methods, p. 1166).
"Relapse was evaluated in 219 women over a 9-year period" (Results, p. 1166).
Example: The findings offer long-term impact by shaping future guidelines for managing endometrial hyperplasia, especially regarding the importance of extended follow-up for women with BMI over 35.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"Primary care clinicians were involved in data collection and follow-up, resulting in a high follow-up rate" (Methods, p. 1166).
Example: Stakeholders include healthcare providers, particularly gynecologists and primary care clinicians, as the study informs their practice in monitoring and managing endometrial hyperplasia.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts:

"BMI 35 or higher was found to be a strong independent predictor of relapse" (Results, p. 1168).
Example: Depth of impact is achieved within gynecology and oncology, influencing treatment decisions for endometrial conditions, especially regarding BMI and relapse risk.

5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts:

"We found that women with BMI 35 or higher have a higher risk of relapse, which could warrant additional interventions or surveillance" (Discussion, p. 1168).
Example: The research findings can be scalable to other populations with obesity-related conditions, while the treatment protocol could be transferable across different healthcare systems.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts:

"The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system induces initial regression more often than oral progestogens" (Discussion, p. 1168).
Example: The use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is an innovation in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, offering a more effective, long-term option compared to oral progestogens.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts:

"Long-term follow-up allows for accurate estimation of outcomes in a prospective cohort" (Methods, p. 1166).
Example: The study emphasizes sustainability by promoting long-term health monitoring, ensuring ethical patient care by offering evidence-based follow-up strategies that prevent relapse in high-risk patients.

8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts:

"The majority of women with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system can be reassured that relapse is rare" (Results, p. 1168).
Example: The usability of this research is high for clinicians, as it provides clear guidance on when to recommend the intrauterine system and how to manage long-term patient care.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts:

"This study could influence gynecology, oncology, and endocrinology by highlighting obesity as a major risk factor in relapse" (Discussion, p. 1168).
Example: This research has cross-disciplinary relevance in areas such as gynecology, endocrinology, and public health due to its implications for obesity management and hormonal treatment strategies.

10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts:

"We measured many variables that may confound our results and adjusted our estimates when necessary" (Methods, p. 1166).
Example: The study showcases resilience by adapting its methodology to account for confounding factors, ensuring robust and adaptable findings that can influence future studies on hyperplasia treatment.

These dimensions demonstrate the study's broad impact, from improving healthcare practices to offering insights into long-term management of hyperplasia, with a focus on patient outcomes tied to obesity and hormonal therapies.
