After reviewing the attached study, there are several potential research impacts across various dimensions. These impacts align with the frameworks and categories outlined in the documents related to research impact​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…). Here's a detailed breakdown of the study’s potential research impacts:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Social and Cultural Impact: The study provides new insights into how second-generation trauma (post-Holocaust) affects individuals and society, influencing collective memory and identity formation. It also deepens the understanding of intergenerational trauma, which can shape social policies around trauma recovery, refugee support, and mental health.
Educational Impact: By contributing to Holocaust and trauma studies, this research can affect curriculum design in history, psychology, and literature, influencing teaching strategies that help students understand the long-term effects of historical events on descendants.
Policy Impact: The findings could influence policymakers in designing trauma-informed social policies, such as mental health interventions for refugee populations and others affected by collective trauma.
Health Impact: The study’s exploration of inherited trauma could inform mental health professionals, providing new approaches for addressing the psychological effects of trauma in children of survivors, leading to improved therapeutic practices.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Long-term Impact: The study’s contributions to trauma theory and Holocaust memory are likely to have enduring significance. As the first-hand witnesses pass away, the research will help future generations understand the lingering psychological effects and societal importance of preserving these memories.
Short-term Impact: Immediate applications in educational settings or public awareness campaigns about the effects of intergenerational trauma may have swift societal uptake, especially in areas focusing on cultural identity and memory preservation.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Academics, mental health professionals, educators, and policymakers directly benefit from the study by gaining knowledge that enhances their practices in trauma studies, memory preservation, and public policy.
Indirect Stakeholders: The general public, especially communities connected to Holocaust survivors and refugees, benefits indirectly as the research fosters better societal understanding and support mechanisms.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has the potential to deeply influence the field of trauma studies by offering a nuanced understanding of second-generation trauma and postmemory, providing a new framework for analyzing how trauma is passed through generations.
Broad Impact: Beyond trauma studies, this research impacts multiple disciplines, such as history, psychology, cultural studies, and education. It may also influence international discussions on collective trauma in various contexts, such as war, refugee crises, and political violence.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study’s findings could be expanded to other contexts beyond the Holocaust, such as refugee communities or societies dealing with the aftermath of civil wars. Programs and interventions based on this research could be scaled up to provide broader mental health support.
Transferability: The concepts of postmemory and intergenerational trauma are transferable to other historical traumas, such as colonialism, slavery, or other genocide studies. The findings can be adapted to different cultural and historical contexts, influencing both local and global approaches to trauma recovery.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: By applying the concept of postmemory, the research introduces an innovative theoretical framework that reshapes traditional approaches to studying trauma. It offers a novel way to explore how memories of traumatic events are inherited and reconstructed by subsequent generations.
Disruption: The study challenges the traditional narrative that trauma can only be experienced directly, proposing instead that inherited trauma can have equally profound psychological and social impacts. This disrupts existing models in psychology and trauma studies and could influence how mental health services are designed.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study supports the long-term preservation of Holocaust memories and trauma awareness, promoting sustainable cultural and historical consciousness. It encourages the ethical treatment of trauma survivors and their descendants, advocating for continuous support and recognition of their lived experiences.
Ethical Considerations: The study handles sensitive subjects, such as trauma and memory, with care, ensuring that the narratives of survivors and their families are respected. This promotes ethical research practices, especially when dealing with vulnerable populations affected by historical violence.
8. Implementation and Usability
The findings of the research are highly usable in mental health care, particularly in designing therapeutic practices for individuals and families affected by intergenerational trauma. It can also be applied in educational programs to enhance students' understanding of the long-lasting effects of historical trauma.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research has relevance across various fields, including psychology, history, literature, sociology, and education, making it a prime example of interdisciplinary research with wide-reaching implications.
Global Relevance: The study’s framework of postmemory and second-generation trauma is applicable to global discussions on trauma, migration, and memory, making it relevant to multiple countries dealing with the legacies of war, genocide, and displacement.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The research is adaptable to emerging challenges, such as the growing global refugee crises, providing a framework for understanding how trauma is transmitted across generations in different cultural and historical settings. Its resilience lies in its applicability to evolving social and cultural contexts where historical trauma continues to shape identities and policies.
Additional Impacts:
Public Awareness and Education: This research can significantly enhance public understanding of how historical traumas affect not only direct victims but also their descendants. Educational campaigns based on the study can raise awareness about the long-term effects of trauma and foster societal empathy.
Cultural Preservation: By focusing on Holocaust narratives, the study contributes to preserving cultural memory and ensuring that the lessons from such historical events continue to inform future generations, preventing the erasure of these important memories.
These potential impacts demonstrate the study’s broad societal, academic, and interdisciplinary influence, making it a valuable contribution to both local and global conversations on trauma, memory, and collective identity.
