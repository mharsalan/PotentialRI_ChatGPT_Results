Based on the research paper "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and the Child Refugees of the 1930s in the UK: History Informing the Future" by Anita Grosz, Stephanie Homer, and Andrea Hammel, I will analyze its impact across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact using detailed excerpts and references from the provided text.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "This study aims to provide enlightening historic context that will aid contemporary research and hopes to inform future strategies which are being developed to support young sanctuary seekers today."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The research has a deep societal and academic impact by contributing to social history and informing current strategies for supporting refugees and mental health in the UK. This paper influences policy, social welfare programs, and mental health frameworks by providing historical parallels.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "This cohort provides us with the opportunity to look at the long-term consequences of their childhood experiences."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The long-term impact is evident in the way this research examines not only the immediate effects of refugee experiences in the 1930s but also their long-lasting impact on adult lives. This informs contemporary studies on trauma, resilience, and child refugee support systems, creating a foundation for future historical and social research.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The findings aim to inform mental health professionals, educators, social workers, and policymakers working with child refugees today."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: Stakeholders include mental health professionals, educators, social service providers, and policymakers. The research offers critical insights into improving interventions for young refugees and emphasizes the importance of mental health support and open communication in mitigating the effects of childhood trauma.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "This report shows that there are several common factors that made a positive difference to the child refugees, although it is crucial to remember that each experience was unique."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The research has deep academic impact within the fields of history, social work, and psychology. The breadth of impact spans across sectors like public policy and mental health services, offering insights into resilience and protective factors in refugee children, influencing both academic discourse and practical interventions.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The study hopes to inform future strategies...to support young sanctuary seekers today."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The findings on resilience and coping mechanisms in historical refugee children are highly transferable to modern contexts. Strategies derived from this research can be applied to current refugee crises, making the research scalable for larger groups of displaced children worldwide, particularly those seeking asylum due to contemporary conflicts.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "Our study also suggests that the most positive outcomes in mitigating the effects of ACEs in child refugees is to aim for 'supported independence' and open communication regarding traumatic experiences."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: This innovative approach challenges traditional refugee support models by promoting supported independence, potentially disrupting conventional child protection and mental health frameworks by emphasizing autonomy and agency for young refugees.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The refugees need to be given safe spaces to discuss their experiences...as children, and also later in life, as adults."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The study promotes long-term mental health sustainability by focusing on open communication and long-term support. It addresses ethical considerations around mental health, advocating for trauma-informed care for child refugees, both at the time of displacement and in adulthood.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "This study aims to provide enlightening historic context that will aid contemporary research and inform future strategies."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The research is highly usable for practitioners in refugee services and child welfare. It provides practical guidelines for implementing trauma-informed care and support strategies, helping educators, social workers, and mental health professionals to create more effective programs for displaced children.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Our research points to the importance of different types of placements...bearing in mind the age, situation, religion and cultural background of the individual child refugee."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The cross-disciplinary nature of this research spans history, social work, psychology, and refugee studies. It has global relevance, as the findings can inform child refugee policies and practices across different nations facing refugee crises, particularly in relation to cultural sensitivity and tailored support mechanisms.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Several factors that promote resilience have been noted...individual factors (the ability to think positively); family factors (positive attachment); and community factors (friendships, school, good community resources)."
Section and Page: Summary, Page 1
Example: The study emphasizes resilience-building strategies for young refugees, highlighting the importance of community support and positive adult relationships. It is adaptable to various refugee contexts, offering insights that can be applied to contemporary displaced populations in different parts of the world.

This detailed impact assessment demonstrates how the study extends beyond its historical context to inform and transform modern refugee support strategies, mental health care, and policy frameworks across multiple disciplines.
