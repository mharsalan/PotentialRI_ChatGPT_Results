Based on the content from the uploaded research paper and file on "Potential Research Impact by Dimensions," I will analyze the research impact dimensions for the study titled “Everyday Life of German-speaking Refugees in Wartime Ireland,” focusing on how this study maps to each of the top 10 research impact dimensions.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study delves into the personal experiences of German-speaking refugees in wartime Ireland, emphasizing everyday life through letters, with a special focus on Kindertransportees and their families. This narrative contributes to social history and refugee studies, particularly in the context of World War II and the Holocaust.
Page Reference: Throughout, with examples starting from pages 1 to 17.
Example: The study impacts the social domain by documenting personal stories, contributing to historical understanding of refugee experiences and their sociocultural implications. The research also offers insights for educational and policy domains by shaping discussions on refugee welfare and memory preservation.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The examination of these letters has long-term implications for how refugee history is studied, preserved, and understood. The letters' preservation is a critical source for both historical and future research.
Page Reference: Examples on pages 6, 7, and 16.
Example: The letters offer long-term impact by preserving memories of the Holocaust and contributing to sustained academic interest in refugee studies, potentially influencing future research in social history and exile studies.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include historians, archivists, and researchers in refugee and social history. Indirectly, it benefits the descendants of refugees, educators, policymakers, and the general public.
Page Reference: Notable on pages 8 and 15.
Example: This research supports educators and historians who work to preserve and teach Holocaust history and the broader implications of forced migration. The public, especially the descendants of refugees, benefit from the historical understanding and preservation of their heritage.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research deeply impacts the specific field of Kindertransport and exile studies while also crossing into social history, educational policies, and public memory studies.
Page Reference: Key discussions on page 6 and beyond.
Example: The depth is evident in its focused analysis on Kindertransport letters, significantly influencing how this period is understood in social history. Broadly, it connects with broader refugee narratives, adding value to cross-disciplinary areas such as trauma studies and human rights advocacy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings could be applied to other refugee studies, especially regarding the experiences of child refugees and forced migrations during wartime.
Page Reference: Examples on pages 3 and 4.
Example: While focusing on German-speaking refugees, the insights from this research can be transferred to other contexts of forced migration, such as contemporary refugee crises. The methodologies of analyzing personal letters and narratives could be scaled for use in other historical contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative ways of understanding the role of everyday communication in shaping refugee identity and survival strategies. By focusing on personal letters, it disrupts traditional historical narratives focused on macro-political events.
Page Reference: Pages 7 and 8.
Example: The innovative focus on everyday life through letters disrupts traditional historical accounts that often prioritize political and military history over personal, lived experiences, offering a more nuanced understanding of wartime refugee life.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research is committed to ethical historical practices by carefully preserving and interpreting personal letters that survived historical traumas. It also contributes to the sustainability of Holocaust memory through education and awareness.
Page Reference: Pages 15-17.
Example: This study promotes sustainability in terms of preserving the historical memory of refugee experiences for future generations. Ethical considerations are paramount, especially in the sensitive handling of traumatic pasts and personal family histories.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research findings can be directly implemented in educational curricula and museum exhibits that focus on refugee history and the Holocaust. The data can be used in public history projects or family heritage initiatives.
Page Reference: Pages 9 and 10.
Example: The letters and insights from this research are highly usable in educational settings, particularly in Holocaust education and refugee history modules, as well as in exhibits dedicated to wartime refugees and Kindertransport.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance, as it merges history, sociology, psychology, and trauma studies. Its focus on German-speaking refugees in Ireland also adds a global dimension to the understanding of World War II's refugee crisis.
Page Reference: Throughout the study.
Example: The study’s insights are globally relevant, particularly for scholars and policymakers dealing with contemporary forced migrations, and it contributes to a cross-disciplinary understanding of refugee survival, memory, and trauma.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The resilience of the refugees, as seen through their letters, showcases adaptability under extreme conditions. The research itself is adaptable for use in different contexts of historical refugee studies.
Page Reference: Pages 10 and 16.
Example: By focusing on the resilience of child refugees, the research underscores the adaptability of personal narratives in coping with war and displacement. It serves as a model for studying other forced migrations across different time periods.
These dimensions highlight the multifaceted impact of the research on wartime refugee experiences, both within academia and broader societal contexts.
