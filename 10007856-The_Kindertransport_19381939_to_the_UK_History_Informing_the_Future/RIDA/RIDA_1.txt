Here is the assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study on the Kindertransport:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"The Kindertransport research shows that there are many variants in narrative and outcome... contributing factors to the endurance and resurgence of the Kindertransport history and memory" (p.110).

"Kindertransport was enabled by a policy change... the British government... the outcome would have been more positive if they had been able to seek refuge in the UK together with their families" (p.110).

Page Reference: Results, page 110. Example: The research primarily impacts the Social and Policy Domains, contributing to Holocaust education, the understanding of refugee experiences, and influencing modern humanitarian policies.

2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"The trauma of separation and loss affected the former Kindertransportees for the rest of their lives" (p.107).

"Kindertransport history and memory... contributing to the endurance and resurgence" (p.110).

Page Reference: Results, pages 107-110. Example: The research has Long-term Impact, affecting not only contemporary historical understandings but also shaping policies on refugees and trauma-informed care, and it continues to impact Holocaust memory and commemoration.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"The British public's role in the Kindertransport... supported by thousands of people, including women who did the majority of work" (p.107).
Page Reference: Results, page 107. Example: Stakeholders include community groups, policymakers, and future generations who benefit from the research, enhancing understanding of humanitarian interventions and refugee policies.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts:

"Kindertransport has become a central part of Holocaust education... a nuanced picture of Kindertransport has brought greater awareness to the British public" (p.109).

"This research moves from testimonies... to critical studies involving archival research" (p.110).

Page Reference: Results, page 109-110. Example: The research has Deep Impact within Holocaust studies and Broad Impact across educational, cultural, and policy domains, influencing refugee discourse and historical memory globally.

5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts:

"The Kindertransport model... has inspired modern refugee movements like the Community Sponsorship Scheme" (p.109).
Page Reference: Results, page 109. Example: The research has Transferability, as the Kindertransport model influenced contemporary refugee programs such as the Community Sponsorship Scheme, addressing modern refugee crises.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts:

"Recent scholarship shows the complexities... moving away from the celebratory narrative" (p.110).
Page Reference: Results, page 110. Example: This research disrupts traditional historical narratives, presenting more complex understandings of the Kindertransport, influencing both academic discussions and public perceptions.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts:

"The separation trauma experienced by Kindertransportees and ethical considerations of how refugee children were treated" (p.107).
Page Reference: Results, page 107. Example: The research emphasizes ethical considerations, focusing on the trauma faced by child refugees and its implications for future refugee policies, promoting sustainable practices in humanitarian aid.

8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts:

"The Kindertransport model has informed refugee support mechanisms in the 21st century" (p.109).
