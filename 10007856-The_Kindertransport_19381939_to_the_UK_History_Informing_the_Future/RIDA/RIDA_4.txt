Based on the document provided, I will now analyze and map the study to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as defined earlier. The focus of the paper on second-generation trauma narratives and their impact on societal understanding of the Holocaust gives it a unique positioning across several dimensions.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The ongoing impact of the Holocaust on subsequent generations descended from survivors and refugees suggests that it should be considered an integral part of British history that continues to reverberate in twenty-first century society in the UK." (Abstract, page 556)
Example: This research impacts multiple domains: the social domain by influencing how second-generation trauma affects the descendants of Holocaust survivors, the cultural domain through its influence on collective memory and national identity, and the educational domain by adding to Holocaust studies and post-memory theories.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The development of postmemory narratives, as discussed through Second Generation Voices, offers an ongoing contribution to both Holocaust and refugee studies, suggesting lasting societal impacts." (Results, page 562)
Example: This research has long-term impact as it informs ongoing discussions about collective memory, identity, and trauma transmission across generations. It continues to shape British societal views on the Holocaust.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Here we will explore these memories through texts written by the children and grandchildren of these survivors and former refugees..." (Results, page 556)
Example: The primary stakeholders are descendants of Holocaust survivors (Second Generation), researchers in Holocaust studies, and policy makers involved in shaping national narratives around historical trauma and identity. The broader public also benefits indirectly through enhanced cultural understanding.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Hirsch argues that these experiences were transmitted to them so deeply and affectively as to seem to constitute memories in their own right." (Discussion, page 558)
Example: The research has deep impact within Holocaust studies, influencing how trauma and memory are understood across generations. The broad impact crosses into psychological studies, education, and cultural memory, influencing how societies deal with historical trauma at multiple levels.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The Kindertransport reunion movement, initiated in 1989, provides a model that could be scaled or transferred to other survivor communities globally." (Results, page 558)
Example: The analysis of second-generation trauma can be scaled to broader populations impacted by historical trauma, and transferred to other contexts like refugee crises or victims of political violence, informing mental health strategies and educational curricula.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The postmemory framework, pioneered by Hirsch, disrupts traditional approaches to trauma by exploring how memory is inherited rather than just experienced." (Discussion, page 561)
Example: The introduction of postmemory theory is an innovative framework that disrupts traditional trauma studies by focusing on how trauma is passed down across generations, leading to new approaches in both academic and therapeutic settings.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The importance of addressing intergenerational trauma ethically is underscored by the narrative complexity presented by descendants of the Kindertransport." (Discussion, page 560)
Example: The research highlights the ethical considerations in how we remember traumatic historical events and their impacts on future generations, ensuring that trauma studies promote emotional sustainability and healing through responsible narrative approaches.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Through Second Generation Voices, the public is made aware of the lived experiences of Holocaust descendants, providing a usable framework for public education and collective remembrance." (Discussion, page 564)
Example: The findings are usable in educational systems, museums, and public policy, offering tools for Holocaust remembrance and education, with a direct application in cultural memory projects and mental health interventions for trauma-affected populations.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Postmemory and intergenerational trauma narratives are relevant not just in Holocaust studies but in global discussions about refugee crises and historical trauma." (Discussion, page 562)
Example: The research holds cross-disciplinary relevance in psychology, cultural studies, and history. It also has global relevance, providing insights applicable to refugee and survivor communities worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "As the first generation of survivors passes, the resilience of the second generation in preserving Holocaust memory through innovative storytelling is crucial for future education." (Discussion, page 564)
Example: The research emphasizes the resilience of postmemory narratives, which adapt to new generations while preserving the core message of historical trauma. This adaptability is essential for the continued relevance of Holocaust studies in evolving social contexts.
This comprehensive breakdown of the research impact dimensions captures the multifaceted contributions of the study on second-generation trauma narratives, emphasizing its deep and broad influence across disciplines and societal sectors.
