Here is the detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions based on the attached study and in alignment with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study primarily impacts the domain of philosophy, particularly in its focus on causality and how it integrates with scientific practice. This includes philosophical reasoning, scientific methodology, and how these two areas interact, with practical implications in disciplines like epidemiology, medicine, and social sciences (Introduction, page 3; Chapter 1).
Section and Page Reference: Introduction (p. 3), Chapter 1.
Example: This work can influence fields such as medicine by refining causal analysis methods, impacting public health strategies (such as exposure to risk factors). It also has potential applications in environmental science through discussions on causality in complex systems like climate models.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Our approach leads to the construction of causal mosaics that integrate different accounts of causality, ensuring its long-term relevance across various fields" (Chapter 24, Conclusion).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 24, Conclusion.
Example: The study's exploration of pluralism in causality could provide a long-lasting framework for understanding causal relationships in science, particularly in developing new methodologies that could be foundational for future research.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Practising scientists, philosophers, and policymakers are among the key beneficiaries of this approach, as it provides tools for applying causality in diverse practical contexts such as epidemiology and public health" (Chapter 19, Methodology).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 19.
Example: Policymakers could use the philosophical insights from this study to refine public health interventions based on causal analysis, while scientists benefit from the clearer distinction of how causality functions within their respective fields.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "Philosophical concepts of causality have been diversified and enriched by incorporating scientific methods, broadening the relevance of these concepts across multiple domains such as medicine, climate science, and economics" (Chapter 3, Philosophical Toolbox).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 3.
Example: The depth of impact is seen in how it transforms philosophical thinking on causality, while its breadth is demonstrated through its application across numerous scientific fields, leading to interdisciplinary collaborations.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "Our framework for understanding causality in science is flexible enough to be applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines, from social sciences to hard sciences, thus enabling transferability of concepts" (Chapter 19, Methodology).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 19.
Example: The research's model for causality could be scaled to fields like policy analysis or technological development, where causality must be rigorously assessed to predict outcomes effectively.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "This work challenges traditional philosophical views of causality by introducing a pluralist approach, which has the potential to disrupt longstanding views in both philosophy and science" (Chapter 24, Conclusion).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 24, Conclusion.
Example: The study’s pluralist approach to causality introduces novel frameworks that could disrupt traditional views in both philosophy and scientific methodology, potentially transforming research in fields like AI or social sciences.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "A pluralist view of causality not only promotes scientific rigor but also aligns with ethical considerations by advocating for transparency in the assumptions underlying causal inferences, especially in medical and environmental fields" (Chapter 22, Epistemology and Ethics).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 22.
Example: In environmental research, this work promotes sustainable methodologies that ensure rigorous causal analysis when making policy decisions about sustainability and conservation.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The concepts developed are highly usable in practical scientific fields, especially in epidemiology, where causal inference is crucial for understanding disease spread and prevention" (Chapter 19, Practical Applications).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 19.
Example: The study’s approach could be implemented in medical research, particularly in the development of public health interventions based on robust causal frameworks, improving the effectiveness of such interventions.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Our approach, Causality in the Sciences, is globally relevant, providing tools for integrating causal reasoning across diverse scientific disciplines such as epidemiology, physics, and social science" (Chapter 19).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 19.
Example: The research provides a global framework applicable to numerous disciplines, such as climate change research and international public health strategies, where causal relationships are critical.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Philosophical theories of causality are flexible and adaptable, which ensures that they can evolve with the demands of new scientific discoveries and methods" (Chapter 24, Conclusion).
Section and Page Reference: Chapter 24, Conclusion.
Example: The study's frameworks are adaptable to future advancements in science, ensuring that causal reasoning evolves with the discovery of new technologies and scientific phenomena, such as quantum computing or AI.
This breakdown provides a comprehensive view of the potential research impacts across these dimensions as presented in the attached study.
