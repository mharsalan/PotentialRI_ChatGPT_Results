Here is a detailed analysis of the research impact based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, derived from the uploaded file:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research contributes significantly to multiple domains such as the environmental, academic, and policy domains by addressing global challenges like climate change and sustainable development.
Page Reference: Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions.txt
Example: Research on the effects of climate change influences not only environmental policies but also contributes to academic discourse in ecology and informs governmental policies regarding carbon output.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: This research generates both short-term and long-term impacts. Immediate effects may include policy shifts or citations, while long-term contributions form foundational knowledge that can influence future research.

Example: Research on AI's role in healthcare has broad impacts, influencing sectors such as law (through privacy policies), public health, and technology. Deep impact is seen in areas like diagnostic tools within the medical field.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: Research demonstrates high scalability when it is applied on a broader scale and high transferability when its principles or findings are adapted to different contexts.

Example: The development of a solar-powered battery system for households can be scaled to supply entire communities, while the technology can also be transferred to other regions to solve energy-related issues globally.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: This dimension assesses the innovative and disruptive capabilities of research, identifying whether it introduces new methodologies or technologies or fundamentally shifts the status quo.
Page Reference: Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions.txt
Example: The development of blockchain technology represents a disruption in industries reliant on secure data transactions, like finance and healthcare, potentially revolutionizing how information is managed.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research contributes to long-term sustainability by offering environmentally conscious solutions and adhering to ethical guidelines that ensure fairness and justice.
Page Reference: Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions.txt
Example: Studies on electric vehicles (EV) foster sustainability by promoting reduced carbon emissions in transportation, aligning with ethical considerations by ensuring equitable access to green technologies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research outcomes are designed for practical application, ensuring ease of implementation in real-world settings by end-users such as policymakers, businesses, or healthcare providers.

Example: A study on the formulation of a single-dose malaria vaccine has high usability, as it can be easily implemented by health workers in regions with high malaria rates, improving public health outcomes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research crosses disciplinary boundaries and holds global relevance by addressing challenges that affect diverse populations worldwide.
Page Reference: Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions.txt
Example: Research on oceanic plastic pollution integrates marine biology, economics, and policy analysis, making it relevant globally by informing international policy on plastic waste reduction.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: Research remains relevant over time (resilience) and can evolve in response to new evidence or challenges (adaptability).
