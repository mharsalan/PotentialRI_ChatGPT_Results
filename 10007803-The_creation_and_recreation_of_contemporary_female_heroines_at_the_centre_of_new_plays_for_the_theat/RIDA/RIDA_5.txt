2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The plays within the study contribute to both short-term critical attention and long-term academic discourse in theater studies and cultural criticism.
Example: Short-term impacts are likely seen in the immediate discussions and performances of the plays, while long-term impacts come from their place in cultural and academic discussions on Scottish theater and societal themes.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include theater professionals, scholars, and audiences. Indirectly, it impacts wider society through the emotional and societal themes presented in the plays.
Example: Researchers and scholars in the fields of theater, culture, and social behavior are direct beneficiaries, while general audiences indirectly benefit by engaging with the societal themes such as grief and ethics explored in the performances.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact

Example: The innovative storytelling could disrupt traditional approaches to narrative in theater by integrating complex societal themes with personal stories, offering new methods for exploring these issues on stage.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research engages with ethical considerations, particularly around themes of grief, societal responsibility, and the consequences of individual choices.
Example: Ethical considerations are at the forefront of the plays, ensuring they align with discussions on justice, fairness, and human responsibility, contributing to broader social discussions on ethics in art and society.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research's primary usability lies in its applicability to theater productions, literary studies, and cultural discussions. The plays can be easily implemented into academic syllabi or adapted for performances in different cultural contexts.
Example: The ease of implementing the research into both educational curricula and theatrical productions ensures its wide usability in academic and creative settings.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The plays deal with universally relevant themes such as grief, ethics, and community, making the research globally relevant across cultural and social boundaries.
Example: The global relevance of the study lies in its exploration of universal human experiences, making it applicable to audiences and researchers worldwide, beyond the immediate cultural context of Scottish theater.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research is adaptable as the themes it explores—grief, ethical dilemmas, and community—are relevant across various times and societies. Its resilience comes from the universality of these themes, which allows the research to remain relevant as societal contexts change.
Example: The adaptability is seen in how the themes can be explored in future theatrical productions and cultural studies, while its resilience ensures it remains part of long-term academic discourse.

Each of these dimensions shows how the research contributes to multiple areas of societal, academic, and cultural importance, emphasizing its broad relevance and deep impact in the fields it touches.
