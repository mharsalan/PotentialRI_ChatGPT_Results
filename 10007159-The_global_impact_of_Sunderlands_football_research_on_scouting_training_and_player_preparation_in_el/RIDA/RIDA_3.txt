Based on the review of the uploaded study document and guidelines provided, here is an analysis of its impact across the top 10 research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"The primary finding of the present study was that a 1-year, twice-weekly combined aerobic and resistance exercise training program was effective for improving muscle strength and CRF in adult women, regardless of age." (Discussion, p. 374).
"This combined training program was effective in improving HR recovery response to exercise in young and early middle-aged, but not in late middle-aged and older women." (Discussion, p. 374).
Examples:

Health Domain: The study directly impacts the healthcare domain by demonstrating the effectiveness of a specific exercise program in improving cardiovascular and muscular health across different age groups. This is especially relevant in preventive care and physical rehabilitation contexts.
Page Reference: Results and Discussion, p. 374.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"The relative increases in CRF and muscle strength after an exercise training program have been generally similar between young and older men and women." (Discussion, p. 374).
Examples:

Long-term Impact: This research will likely contribute to long-term impact as it provides foundational data on how exercise programs influence cardiovascular and muscular health over time, supporting ongoing improvements in exercise science and geriatric health interventions.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 374.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"All volunteers read a detailed description of the protocol and provided their written informed consent." (Methods, p. 373).
Examples:

Healthcare Providers and Researchers: The primary stakeholders are healthcare providers and fitness specialists who may use these findings to tailor exercise programs. Researchers also benefit as they can build on this long-term intervention data to further explore age-related health outcomes.
Page Reference: Methods, p. 373.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"No significant differences were observed between groups in the percentage of CRF improvement." (Results, p. 374).
Examples:

Deep Impact: The study contributes deeply to the understanding of how combined aerobic and resistance training affects cardiovascular recovery and muscle strength specifically in women. It refines the approach to fitness across the lifespan, a significant focus area in health research.
Page Reference: Results, p. 374.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Combined aerobic and resistance training at a frequency of 2 days/week improves CRF and muscle strength throughout the lifespan." (Abstract, p. 372).
Examples:

Scalability: The exercise program can be scaled to broader populations, potentially benefiting older adults globally by reducing cardiovascular risks. Additionally, it is simple to apply across different healthcare or fitness settings.
Page Reference: Abstract, p. 372.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that compared the effects of a long-term combined resistance and aerobic exercise training on CRF, muscle strength, and HR recovery response to exercise among adult women of different age groups." (Discussion, p. 374).
Examples:

Innovation: This is one of the first studies to examine long-term effects of this specific exercise regimen on women of different ages, filling a gap in the literature. It provides new evidence for how exercise adaptations vary across the lifespan, particularly in the context of heart rate recovery, which can change training protocols.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 374.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"A medical history review and physical evaluation were performed before exercise testing to document any symptoms, history of chronic diseases, current medication, cardiac risk factors and events." (Methods, p. 373).
Examples:

Ethical Considerations: The study ensured ethical integrity by following medical screening processes, obtaining informed consent, and adhering to ethical guidelines. Sustainability is addressed by demonstrating a practical, long-term exercise intervention that can promote lifelong health benefits.
Page Reference: Methods, p. 373.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The exercise training program was effective in improving muscle strength in all groups." (Results, p. 374).
Examples:

Usability: The exercise program is simple, with only two sessions per week, making it easy for healthcare professionals to implement in various clinical settings, especially for elderly populations who may have time constraints or health limitations.
Page Reference: Results, p. 374.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Exercise-induced improvements in HR recovery response to exercise may be impaired in late middle-aged and older women." (Abstract, p. 372).
Examples:

Global Relevance: The study’s insights into age-related differences in exercise adaptation are relevant for healthcare systems worldwide, particularly for aging populations facing cardiovascular health challenges. It can inform global health interventions aimed at improving physical activity guidelines for older adults.
Page Reference: Abstract, p. 372.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Aerobic exercise adaptation was considered an exercise HR between 60–70% of the subjects’ reserve HR and scale of perceived effort of 11–13." (Methods, p. 373).
Examples:

Adaptability: The exercise program’s design allows for adjustments based on participant progress, making it adaptable to varying levels of fitness, which increases its applicability to a wide demographic.
