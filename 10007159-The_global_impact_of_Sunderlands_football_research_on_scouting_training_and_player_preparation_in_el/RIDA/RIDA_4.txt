To assess the research impact dimensions for the study "Impact of lumbar spine posture on thoracic spine motion and muscle activation patterns" from the uploaded document, I will detail each dimension based on the content of the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Changes in thoracic motion were modified by lumbar spine posture, highlighting the importance of considering a multi-segmented approach when analyzing trunk motion" (Discussion, page 10). Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 10. Example: This research primarily impacts the health domain, specifically in spine biomechanics and musculoskeletal health. By informing healthcare professionals and ergonomists about how lumbar posture affects thoracic spine motion, this study contributes to improving workplace ergonomics, physical therapy techniques, and the design of exercise regimens aimed at preventing back injuries.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Combined postures have been previously identified as potential injury modulators, and bilateral muscle patterns can have an effect on loading pathways" (Results, page 3). Page Reference and Section: Results, page 3. Example: The short-term impact includes practical applications in workplace ergonomics and rehabilitation protocols, reducing the risk of thoracic spine injuries. Long-term, the findings may serve as a basis for further research into spine biomechanics, potentially influencing occupational health guidelines over time.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"As people tend to move in a variety of postures at home... it is important to understand the interactions among different regions of the spine during typical postures" (Introduction, page 2). Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 2. Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare providers (physical therapists, chiropractors) who can use these insights to tailor treatment for back pain. Indirectly, workers in physically demanding jobs and the general public benefit from safer workplace practices and better ergonomic recommendations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Thoracic flexion increased in a superior–inferior direction only during the maximum flexion trials, and the lower-thoracic region was the only one to further increase flexion angle with increased lumbar flexion" (Results, page 5). Page Reference and Section: Results, page 5. Example: The study has deep impact within the field of biomechanics, providing new insights into the relationship between different spinal regions. It could have broad impact on health and safety in occupations involving repetitive or awkward movements, influencing fields like occupational health, physiotherapy, and sports medicine.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Understanding these interactions during daily tasks may help in injury prevention, especially in manual labor occupations" (Discussion, page 9). Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 9. Example: The findings are scalable, as they could influence ergonomic interventions at different scales—from small-scale modifications in individual workstations to national safety guidelines. Additionally, they are transferable to other fields like physical rehabilitation and sports science, helping improve performance and prevent injuries in athletes.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"Considering the spine itself is not a rigid column, it has been suggested that a multi-segment approach is necessary to fully understand task-dependent kinematic movement patterns" (Introduction, page 2). Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 2. Example: This study introduces an innovative approach by focusing on a multi-segment analysis of the spine, moving beyond traditional views of the spine as a rigid structure. While not disruptive, this nuanced understanding of spinal motion could lead to more effective treatments and injury prevention techniques in clinical settings.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The findings may contribute to injury prevention strategies in various workplaces, potentially reducing the long-term health care costs associated with back injuries" (Discussion, page 10). Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 10. Example: The research promotes sustainability in healthcare by potentially reducing the prevalence of chronic back pain, which in turn may lower healthcare costs and improve the long-term well-being of workers. Ethically, it supports the development of safer, more effective interventions for preventing occupational injuries.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The lower-thoracic region had significantly more flexion than the upper- and mid-thoracic regions during combined postures, suggesting targeted interventions" (Results, page 5). Page Reference and Section: Results, page 5. Example: The research findings are highly usable in clinical and occupational health settings. Physical therapists can implement specific exercises targeting the lower thoracic region, and occupational safety programs can integrate posture awareness to reduce injury risks.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Given the high prevalence of thoracic spine pain in manual laborers, this research could be applicable in various industries" (Introduction, page 2). Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 2. Example: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance, affecting fields such as biomechanics, occupational health, ergonomics, and physical therapy. It also has global relevance due to the universal nature of spine health concerns across various labor-intensive industries worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"By understanding how posture impacts muscle activation, interventions can be adapted to reduce injury risk in different environments" (Discussion, page 9). Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 9. Example: The study highlights the spine's resilience and adaptability by exploring how different postures influence muscle activation and spine motion. This knowledge can be applied to design interventions that adapt to various occupational settings, enhancing workers' ability to perform tasks without injury.
