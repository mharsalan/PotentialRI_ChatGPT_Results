Based on my analysis of the provided study, "Factors Influencing Physical and Technical Variability in the English Premier League," I have assessed its research impact across several key dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "This study demonstrates the variability of physical and technical performance parameters across positional and contextual factors in the English Premier League (EPL)."
Section/Page: Results, p. 12
Example: This research impacts the sports performance domain by providing critical data on variability in player performance, which can be applied in training, game strategy, and talent evaluation. This can extend into sports medicine by influencing injury prevention strategies due to physical performance patterns.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The variability found in technical and physical performance has long-term implications for training and performance evaluation in elite football."
Section/Page: Discussion, p. 10
Example: In the short-term, this research offers immediate insights for coaching decisions and performance analysis. Long-term, it lays a foundation for future studies in sports science by contributing to a growing database on player variability, influencing training methodologies and sports analytics.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: "This study provides useful information for practitioners in elite soccer, extending previous research on physical and technical performance."
Section/Page: Practical Applications, p. 11
Example: Direct stakeholders include football coaches, performance analysts, and sports scientists, who can apply the findings to optimize player performance and team strategies. Indirect stakeholders include fans, who benefit from improved gameplay, and sports organizations, which can enhance player development programs.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The present study was the first to quantify the match-to-match variability of physical and technical parameters."
Section/Page: Discussion, p. 12
Example: The deep impact is seen in how it fundamentally changes the way performance variability is understood in football, particularly in elite settings. Its broad impact could extend beyond football into other team sports where performance variability plays a critical role in strategy and outcomes, such as rugby or basketball.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "Data on variability in match play can be used to optimize performance assessments across different sports and playing levels."
Section/Page: Conclusion, p. 11
Example: The research is highly scalable, as it can be applied to youth leagues and other professional football leagues globally. Its transferability lies in its potential to be adapted for other sports like rugby or basketball, where player performance variability is similarly affected by positional and contextual factors.
This analysis highlights the study's multifaceted impact across key research domains, its potential for short- and long-term applications, and its relevance to various stakeholders.
