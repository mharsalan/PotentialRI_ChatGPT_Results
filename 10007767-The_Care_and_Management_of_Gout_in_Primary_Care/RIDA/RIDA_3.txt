Based on your provided research paper and the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here are the detailed dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "We sought to investigate the association between gout and incident CHD, CVD, and PVD in a large sample of the UK general practice population." This research falls within the health domain, focusing on understanding the cardiovascular risks linked to gout, impacting healthcare and medical treatment practices for managing chronic inflammatory conditions like gout.
Page Reference: Methods section, page 18​(3).
Example: This research impacts the health domain by improving understanding of how chronic conditions like gout contribute to cardiovascular risks, potentially informing medical guidelines and public health strategies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Further work is required to establish the effect of optimum management of both vascular risk factors and gout itself on the long-term health of gout patients." The research contributes both short-term and long-term impacts by addressing immediate cardiovascular risk management while also laying the groundwork for future long-term health management strategies.
Page Reference: Results section, page 16​(3).
Example: In the short term, this research could inform immediate clinical guidelines for better managing gout in primary care. Over the long term, it may influence policies on the treatment of chronic diseases related to cardiovascular risks.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Patients consulting in primary care between 1987 and 1999, with an incident diagnosis of gout, were identified. Potential control subjects with no history." The primary stakeholders include patients suffering from gout, healthcare providers who manage these conditions, and public health policymakers.
Page Reference: Methods section, page 18​(3).
Example: Direct stakeholders are healthcare providers and patients, as the research informs better management strategies. Indirect stakeholders include public health bodies who might leverage the findings for broader health policy development.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The association between gout and subsequent CHD and PVD in both sexes, independent of traditional vascular risk factors." This research demonstrates deep impact within medical research related to chronic disease management, particularly in identifying gender differences in cardiovascular risk.
Page Reference: Results section, page 16​(3).
Example: The study’s deep impact is seen in its detailed exploration of cardiovascular risks for gout patients, while the breadth of its impact extends to influencing treatment protocols in primary care, cardiology, and public health policy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is the largest database of electronic primary care health records." The study's methodology can be scaled and transferred to other population-based studies examining chronic disease comorbidities across different regions and healthcare systems.
Page Reference: Methods section, page 18​(3).
Example: The scalability of this research lies in its large dataset, which can be used to study other inflammatory conditions across different demographics. Its transferability includes potential application in different healthcare systems outside the UK, leveraging electronic health records.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "This study suggests an association between gout and subsequent CHD and PVD in both sexes, independent of traditional vascular risk factors." The findings challenge the traditional understanding of gout as merely an intermittent condition and suggest its chronic impact on cardiovascular health.
Page Reference: Discussion section, page 16​(3).
Example: This research could disrupt existing clinical practices by necessitating new management protocols for gout patients, with a focus on cardiovascular risk, potentially changing how chronic inflammatory diseases are treated.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The study uses data from the UK CPRD, the largest database of electronic primary care health records." The study supports sustainable healthcare practices by leveraging large-scale data to address long-term health risks of chronic conditions, ensuring effective use of resources for large populations.
Page Reference: Methods section, page 18​(3).
Example: The use of large electronic health record databases promotes sustainability in medical research by enabling the efficient use of existing data, reducing the need for new data collection, and minimizing the environmental and financial costs associated with such studies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "Further work is required to establish the effect of optimum management of both vascular risk factors and gout." This research directly informs clinical guidelines for the management of gout in primary care, making the findings highly applicable for healthcare providers.
Page Reference: Results section, page 16​(3).
Example: The study’s results can be readily implemented in clinical settings to improve the management of cardiovascular risks in gout patients, contributing to more personalized healthcare.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Hyperuricaemia has been linked with an increased incidence of, and mortality from, both CHD and stroke." This research is relevant across multiple disciplines, including cardiology, rheumatology, and epidemiology, and has global implications for managing chronic disease comorbidities.
Page Reference: Introduction section, page 18​(3).
Example: The study's findings are globally relevant as they can influence healthcare guidelines and chronic disease management strategies worldwide, particularly in countries with high prevalence of gout and cardiovascular disease.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Epidemiological studies examining the relationship between gout and CHD report conflicting findings." The study demonstrates adaptability by addressing gaps in previous research and adapting its methodology to investigate long-term health impacts of gout using a large-scale data set.
Page Reference: Introduction section, page 18​(3).
Example: The research adapts to previous knowledge gaps by using comprehensive data and could be adapted further to explore other inflammatory conditions or in different population subsets.
