Here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the study on gout epidemiology as per the guidelines:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "The study reports a 63.9% increase in the prevalence of gout and a 29.6% increase in incidence over the period from 1997 to 2012" (Results, page 663).
Page Reference: Results, page 663.
Example: This research primarily impacts the health domain by providing updated epidemiological data on gout. It may influence healthcare systems in managing gout through better allocation of resources and public health policies to address increasing gout cases.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "Despite this rising prevalence and the publication of European and UK guidelines in 2006 and 2007, the management of gout appears to be suboptimal with only one in three prevalent patients receiving ULT and only one in four newly diagnosed patients receiving ULT within 1 year of diagnosis" (Discussion, page 665).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 665.
Example: The study has short-term impacts on public health interventions by highlighting current management gaps. Long-term impacts could include ongoing influence on treatment guidelines, improving adherence rates to urate-lowering therapies (ULT).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "Only 48.48% of patients were being consulted specifically for gout or treated with ULT and of these, 37.63% received ULT" (Results, page 663).
Page Reference: Results, page 663.
Example: Key stakeholders include healthcare providers, who benefit by understanding treatment gaps, and policy makers, who may adjust healthcare policies to promote more effective gout treatment strategies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Gout is not distributed uniformly within the UK, with the highest prevalence and incidence of gout being in the North East and Wales" (Results, page 663).
Page Reference: Results, page 663.
Example: The study has deep impact on understanding regional variations in gout management, influencing both clinical practice and public health policies. Its findings could lead to region-specific interventions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Regions with the highest prevalence and incidence were the North East and Wales" (Results, page 663).
Page Reference: Results, page 663.
Example: The study's methodology can be scaled to other regions or countries with similar demographic profiles. The approach can be transferred to healthcare systems aiming to improve gout management by adopting similar research models in diverse populations.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The prevalence and incidence of gout have increased significantly in the UK, but patient adherence to ULT remains poor" (Results, page 665).
Page Reference: Results, page 665.
Example: The research disrupts traditional assumptions about gout management and may lead to innovative strategies to improve patient adherence through new public health interventions.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Adherence to ULT among prevalent gout patients was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC) to represent the degree of prescription-filling in a given interval specified" (Methods, page 662).
Page Reference: Methods, page 662.
Example: Addressing ethical considerations, the study highlights the need for improved access to medications and adherence strategies, ensuring fair treatment for gout patients across socio-economic groups.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The percentage of patients receiving ULT improved from 28.28% in 1997 to 39.66% in 2012" (Results, page 664).
Page Reference: Results, page 664.
Example: The study's findings can be used by healthcare providers and policymakers to implement better treatment adherence strategies for gout, enhancing the usability of treatment guidelines and patient outcomes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Gout results from the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals due to persistent elevation of uric acid levels" (Introduction, page 661).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 661.
Example: The research has global relevance due to its implications on managing chronic diseases like gout, which affects millions worldwide. The cross-disciplinary nature of combining epidemiology with public health makes it valuable across multiple fields.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "Patient adherence to ULT improved during the study period, but it remains poor" (Results, page 664).
Page Reference: Results, page 664.
Example: The findings show the adaptability of treatment strategies and guidelines to address the increasing prevalence of gout, suggesting resilient health systems are required to handle the growing burden effectively.
