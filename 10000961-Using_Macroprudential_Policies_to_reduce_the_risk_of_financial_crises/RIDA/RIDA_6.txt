Based on the document content provided in Knowledge - Potential Research Impact by Dimensions, the attached study on The Effects of Macroprudential Policy on Banks' Profitability can be analyzed across multiple research impact dimensions. Below is a detailed breakdown of each dimension and the corresponding potential impacts of the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: This study primarily impacts the academic field of financial economics by contributing to the growing body of literature on macroprudential regulation and its effects on bank profitability. It uses a vast dataset of global banks and provides new empirical evidence on how different macroprudential tools affect financial stability.
Example: The research provides key insights into how different banks, particularly smaller and well-capitalized institutions, are more affected by macroprudential policies. This influences future academic research on bank stability, financial regulation, and profitability metrics​.
Economic Domain: The study significantly influences the economic domain by addressing how banks’ lending behaviors and profitability are shaped by regulatory changes. This has broader implications for the stability of financial systems and economic growth across different countries.
Example: Policymakers in emerging markets could use the study’s findings to tailor macroprudential policies that are more appropriate for their banking sectors, leading to economic stability​.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: In the short term, the study provides immediate guidance to financial regulators who are seeking ways to mitigate systemic risks and support financial stability through effective regulation.
Example: Financial institutions might adjust their business models and lending strategies quickly based on the study’s findings on how capital requirements and loan-loss provisioning affect bank profitability​.
Long-term Impact: Over the long term, the study will influence ongoing financial regulatory reforms, particularly those related to banking stability and profitability, as the findings provide a deeper understanding of how macroprudential policies shape bank behavior across different economic environments​.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
Policymakers: The study provides crucial insights for central banks and financial regulators. These stakeholders will use the research to design macroprudential policies that balance financial stability with bank profitability​.
Banking Institutions: Banks, especially smaller or highly capitalized ones, are direct stakeholders as they are affected by the implementation of macroprudential policies. The findings will help them strategize their operations to mitigate the impact on profitability​.
Indirect Stakeholders:
The Public: By contributing to financial stability and reducing systemic risks, the study indirectly benefits the public by minimizing the risks of financial crises that can disrupt economies​.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a deep impact on the specialized field of bank profitability under regulatory pressure. It fills a gap in the literature by analyzing how macroprudential policies affect banks differently based on size and capital structures.
Example: It profoundly influences the understanding of how specific regulatory measures, such as capital adequacy requirements, affect smaller banks and could inform future regulatory adjustments​.
Broad Impact: The findings have broader implications across policy-making, bank management, and global financial stability, especially in regions with differing economic development levels.
Example: The study’s results can influence regulatory approaches in both advanced and emerging economies, affecting global financial stability​.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The research is scalable as its findings can be applied across various global contexts, from developed economies to emerging markets. The scalability is evident in the large dataset (7250 banks globally) and its application to different regulatory environments.
Example: Policymakers in both advanced and emerging markets can scale the findings to apply macroprudential policies tailored to their specific economic conditions​.
Transferability: The methodologies used in this study (e.g., panel OLS regression) are transferable to other fields of financial risk management, including non-banking sectors.
Example: The research methods could be adapted to assess the impact of regulatory policies on investment firms or insurance companies​.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study offers a novel empirical analysis of how macroprudential regulations affect profitability, with particular attention to differences between bank types and sizes. This fills a significant gap in the research on the unintended consequences of regulation.
Example: The innovative approach of examining profitability through micro banking data, rather than relying solely on macroeconomic data, sets a new standard for assessing the impact of financial regulations​.
Disruption: The research challenges existing assumptions about macroprudential policies, particularly the notion that these regulations uniformly benefit financial stability without affecting profitability.
Example: Policymakers may need to reassess how they design macroprudential measures to avoid unintentionally undermining bank profitability, especially in smaller institutions​.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes the sustainability of financial systems by analyzing how regulatory measures can balance bank profitability with long-term financial stability.
Example: By suggesting adjustments to macroprudential policies that mitigate adverse effects on small banks, the research encourages a more sustainable banking environment​.
Ethical Considerations: It highlights potential ethical concerns regarding the impact of macroprudential policies on small banks, particularly the need to avoid excessive regulatory burdens that could harm competition and economic equity​.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research findings are highly usable for financial regulators looking to design tailored macroprudential policies. The detailed analysis of how different bank types are affected by specific regulations provides actionable insights.
Example: Central banks could immediately implement capital requirement adjustments and lending limits based on the study’s recommendations​.
Usability for Financial Institutions: Banks could use the findings to adjust their business models and mitigate the impact of macroprudential regulations on profitability​.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary: While rooted in financial economics, the study’s findings are relevant to fields such as public policy, risk management, and banking law.
Example: The research could influence cross-disciplinary collaborations between financial regulators and economists, leading to more integrated financial policies that consider both risk mitigation and profitability​.
Global Relevance: The study has broad global relevance, with findings that apply to banking systems across the world, particularly in the context of managing systemic risk post-global financial crisis​.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The research enhances the resilience of financial systems by identifying how macroprudential policies can be adapted to different banking structures to reduce risks while maintaining profitability.
Example: Policymakers can use the study to ensure that financial systems remain resilient to crises without overburdening smaller banks​.
Adaptability: The findings are adaptable across different economic contexts, with practical recommendations for both advanced economies and emerging markets on how to apply macroprudential policies effectively​.
Conclusion
This study on the effects of macroprudential policy on bank profitability has significant potential impacts across multiple research dimensions. It influences not only academic discourse but also policy-making, economic stability, and financial regulation globally. By providing new insights into the effects of regulation on profitability, especially in small and highly capitalized banks, the research offers practical and scalable solutions to improve financial stability while ensuring a sustainable and profitable banking sector.
