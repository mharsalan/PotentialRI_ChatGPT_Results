Here is a detailed breakdown of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions based on the attached study "Evaluating Concentration and Distribution Measures of IMF Financial Soundness Indicators" by Philip Davis​:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study significantly impacts the academic domain by advancing methodologies used in financial surveillance and stability analysis, particularly in the use of Concentration and Distribution Measures (CDMs) for predicting systemic risks in the banking sector. It also contributes to the economic domain by offering policy-relevant insights on how financial institutions can improve risk management practices based on CDM data.
Example: The findings are crucial for international financial institutions, central banks, and financial regulators in strengthening global financial surveillance, making it highly relevant to policy and economic domains.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study provides both short-term impacts by improving current practices in financial surveillance (e.g., the IMF's use of CDMs) and long-term impacts by laying the groundwork for more sophisticated models of systemic risk management.
Example: Short-term impact involves immediate changes in how CDMs are applied in financial monitoring by central banks. Long-term impact comes from influencing future methodologies for systemic risk assessment in financial systems.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: The key stakeholders include financial regulators, central banks, academic researchers, international organizations (e.g., IMF, ECB), and policymakers. The general public and financial institutions are also indirect stakeholders, benefiting from improved financial stability.
Example: Regulators and policymakers use the study’s findings to implement stronger financial stability frameworks, while researchers can build on its methodologies to explore new areas in financial risk modeling​.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The study has a deep impact within the field of financial stability, offering rigorous econometric models to assess systemic risks using CDMs. It also has broad impact by influencing multiple sectors, including academia, international policy, and banking regulations.
Example: The deep impact is seen in how it reshapes academic approaches to financial surveillance, while the broad impact extends to influencing policies at international institutions like the Bank of England and ECB​​.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The research is scalable, as CDMs can be applied across different countries and banking systems. It is also transferable to various financial sectors beyond banking, such as insurance or investment management.
Example: CDMs can be scaled to global financial systems, improving risk management in emerging and advanced economies. They can also be transferred to corporate governance and non-banking financial institutions​.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The study is innovative in its application of quantile regressions and panel estimates to financial soundness indicators. It disrupts traditional surveillance models by introducing CDMs, which offer a more granular view of systemic risks than simple averages.
Example: By incorporating CDMs into financial stability frameworks, the study has the potential to disrupt how central banks and regulatory authorities monitor systemic financial risks, leading to more proactive risk management​​.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The study contributes to the sustainability of financial systems by promoting the use of data-driven measures to prevent systemic crises. It addresses ethical considerations by advocating for transparency in risk management practices, reducing the likelihood of financial instability that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations.
Example: By identifying early warning signs of financial crises, the research promotes sustainable economic practices and protects against financial collapses that could harm socially vulnerable groups​.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The study’s findings can be directly implemented by financial institutions and central banks to enhance their monitoring systems for financial soundness. The CDMs are readily usable in real-world financial surveillance.
Example: Central banks can integrate the study’s CDM framework into their regular risk assessment models to improve the accuracy of financial stability reporting​​.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research crosses disciplinary boundaries, incorporating insights from economics, data science, and policy analysis. Its global relevance is underscored by the data collected from 36 countries, making it applicable across different financial systems worldwide.
Example: The research is relevant for global policymakers and international organizations (e.g., IMF, World Bank), and can influence cross-disciplinary collaborations between economists and data scientists​.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study enhances the resilience of financial systems by equipping policymakers with tools to detect and respond to early signs of systemic risks. It advocates for adaptive policy frameworks that can respond to evolving economic conditions.
Example: By improving the ability of financial systems to adapt to crisis conditions through the use of CDMs, the study contributes to more resilient global financial infrastructures​.
These dimensions illustrate the comprehensive impact the study can have on financial regulation, academic research, and global economic stability.
