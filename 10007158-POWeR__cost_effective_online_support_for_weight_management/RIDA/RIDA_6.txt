Based on the detailed analysis of the paper titled "Using mixed methods to develop and evaluate an online weight management intervention" and aligned with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is a dimension-by-dimension assessment of its research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The study focuses on the health domain, specifically on developing and evaluating an e-health intervention called POWeR for sustainable weight loss. It integrates human support and explores its impact on the effectiveness of the intervention (pg 45-47).
Page Reference: Methods and Results, pages 45-47.
Example: The POWeR program's impact extends to healthcare systems by providing an alternative to traditional weight management interventions, potentially improving public health outcomes through accessible online tools.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The research has both short-term and long-term impacts. The short-term impact is evident in the immediate acceptability of the POWeR intervention in trials (pg 48). Long-term impact includes its potential for sustainable weight loss over time (pg 49).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 49-50.
Example: In the short term, the intervention shows promise in reducing weight in users; in the long term, it fosters autonomy, suggesting that with basic support, users can maintain weight loss without reliance on continuous human support.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: Stakeholders include healthcare providers, researchers, and users (patients). For example, healthcare providers benefit from a scalable and feasible tool for managing weight loss, while patients directly benefit from improved health outcomes (pg 47-50).
Page Reference: Results and Discussion, pages 47-50.
Example: Primary care providers can use POWeR as part of their toolkit to assist patients in weight management, thus expanding access to weight loss interventions for broader populations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: The research has deep impact within healthcare, influencing the development of online weight management programs and providing insights into the role of human support. It also has broad applications across sectors, as the intervention could be adapted for use in community health settings and beyond (pg 48-51).
Page Reference: Results, page 49-51.
Example: While the deep impact is on healthcare, particularly primary care settings, the POWeR program has broad potential applications in community health and other online health interventions globally.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: POWeR is highly scalable as it is an online intervention that can be delivered at a large scale, and its minimal reliance on human support increases its feasibility for broader use (pg 50). Transferability is demonstrated by its potential use in various contexts, including primary care and community settings (pg 51).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 50-51.
Example: The scalability of the program makes it suitable for widespread implementation in public health campaigns, while its principles could be transferred to other health interventions, such as diabetes management or mental health programs.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative methods by combining an online intervention with varied levels of human support. This hybrid approach challenges traditional face-to-face weight loss programs by offering a potentially more scalable and less resource-intensive solution (pg 47-48).
Page Reference: Methods and Results, pages 47-48.
Example: The disruption lies in replacing traditional weight loss approaches with a more accessible, user-friendly online model, potentially transforming how weight management services are delivered in both clinical and community settings.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: Ethical considerations include the emphasis on autonomous motivation, fostering sustainable behavior change in users (pg 50). The program's design to be cost-effective and accessible also promotes sustainability by reducing the need for constant professional intervention (pg 48-49).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 48-50.
Example: By encouraging users to self-regulate and sustain weight loss without relying on continuous external support, the POWeR intervention promotes long-term health sustainability and ethical use of resources.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: The research highlights the usability of the POWeR intervention through a user-friendly interface, complemented by brief human support that enhances engagement without creating dependency (pg 49-50).
Page Reference: Results, pages 49-50.
Example: POWeR can be implemented in various healthcare settings with minimal training, making it an easy-to-use solution for both patients and healthcare professionals.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: The intervention's online nature allows for cross-disciplinary application, combining insights from psychology, behavioral health, and healthcare technology. Its potential global relevance is highlighted by its low-cost scalability (pg 47-50).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 47-50.
Example: POWeR could be adapted for use in diverse cultural contexts, addressing global challenges in weight management by offering a flexible, culturally-sensitive online tool.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: The intervention is adaptable, as it can be modified based on user feedback and refined for various levels of support depending on the healthcare setting (pg 47-48). Its resilience is evident in its ability to foster long-term weight loss without continuous support (pg 49-50).
Page Reference: Results, pages 49-50.
Example: The flexibility of the POWeR program allows it to be resilient in the face of varying patient needs and healthcare environments, making it a sustainable solution for weight management across different regions and populations.
This analysis aligns the study with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," emphasizing its potential to influence healthcare practices, its scalability, and its innovative approach to weight management.
