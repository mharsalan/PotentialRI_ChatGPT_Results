By addressing obesity, it potentially reduces related diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.
Educational Domain: The study contributes to educating both healthcare professionals and patients. It empowers patients with knowledge about weight management while helping healthcare practitioners adopt digital tools to enhance their consultations.
Policy Domain: This research could influence public health policies related to obesity management in primary care settings. It provides evidence for the use of digital health interventions, potentially guiding future policies to integrate such tools in healthcare systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediate benefits from the study include improving practitioner-patient interactions concerning weight management. POWeR+ provides healthcare practitioners with an effective tool for managing weight, which can be implemented quickly in clinical settings.
Long-term Impact: The long-term effects may include sustained improvements in public health by tackling obesity at scale. Over time, this tool could reduce healthcare costs associated with treating obesity-related diseases and be adapted to manage other chronic conditions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Healthcare Providers: Direct beneficiaries include general practitioners (GPs) and nurses who can better manage patients' weight issues using POWeR+.
Patients and the Public: The primary beneficiaries are patients who gain access to more effective and accessible weight management services. The broader public benefits from improved healthcare delivery and potential reductions in the public health burden of obesity.
Policymakers: Indirect stakeholders may include policymakers who could adopt this intervention in national weight management guidelines​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The research has deep implications within primary healthcare by enhancing the approach to managing weight and obesity. It may fundamentally change how GPs and nurses approach patient counseling on weight management.
Breadth: The tool has broad potential, as it could be adapted to other chronic diseases beyond obesity. It could be scaled to different healthcare systems globally, affecting multiple sectors such as public health, clinical practices, and digital healthcare innovation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The POWeR+ tool can be scaled beyond the initial study settings to national and international healthcare systems, making it a viable tool for widespread implementation in primary care settings globally.
Transferability: The tool’s principles—combining human support with digital interventions—can be transferred to other areas of chronic disease management, such as diabetes or cardiovascular health, where patient engagement and self-management are critical​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The integration of digital technology into routine weight management is an innovative approach in primary care, offering an accessible and scalable solution to a pervasive health issue.
Disruption: This research challenges traditional face-to-face care models by showing that effective patient support can also be provided through digital tools, potentially reducing the need for in-person consultations and disrupting traditional healthcare practices​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes sustainable healthcare practices by introducing a cost-effective, scalable model for managing a chronic health issue like obesity. It reduces the reliance on in-person consultations and promotes self-management, which is essential for long-term health improvements.
Ethical Considerations: The research enhances patient autonomy by providing them with tools for self-management, aligning with ethical healthcare principles of patient empowerment and responsibility​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application: The POWeR+ tool demonstrates strong usability in real-world healthcare settings, offering healthcare providers an easy-to-use intervention for managing obesity. It was found to be straightforward to implement, though some practitioners noted time constraints in integrating it into their schedules​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research integrates health, digital technology, and education, making it relevant across multiple fields such as public health, medical informatics, and patient education.
Global Relevance: Obesity is a global health issue, and the POWeR+ tool has the potential for adaptation and implementation in healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in regions struggling with obesity and related chronic conditions​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The research shows that the POWeR+ tool can adapt to challenges in healthcare settings, including practitioner time constraints and the need for technological integration. Its adaptability ensures it remains relevant as digital health tools continue to evolve​(impact pathway).
11. Health and Well-being Impact
Health Outcomes: The primary impact of the research lies in improving health outcomes by offering a new tool for weight management. Effective management of obesity can lead to reductions in obesity-related diseases, improving overall population health and well-being​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Economic Impact
Cost Savings: By reducing the need for in-person consultations and empowering patients to manage their health independently, the study has the potential to lower healthcare costs associated with managing obesity and its related conditions​(Research impact toolkit).
13. Public Awareness and Education
Patient Education: The POWeR+ tool not only provides healthcare professionals with a resource but also educates patients on effective weight management strategies, potentially leading to greater public awareness of healthy lifestyles and preventive care​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
14. Technological Advancement
