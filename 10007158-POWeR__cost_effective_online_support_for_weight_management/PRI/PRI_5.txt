After reviewing the entire research study, several potential research impacts emerge. These impacts align with various dimensions of research impact, providing both academic and societal benefits. Below is a detailed account of the potential impacts this study might have:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
Contribution to Health Outcomes: The study highlights the effectiveness of using hybrid digital platforms (website and app) for weight management. By improving users' motivation, self-regulation, and goal achievement, this research directly contributes to better health outcomes, particularly in managing obesity and promoting healthier lifestyles. The research findings can influence public health strategies, especially those aimed at preventing obesity and related health complications.
Example: This impact is evident as participants who used the app reported higher awareness and motivation toward healthier eating goals​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Technological Innovation and Usability
Development of Usable Tools: The research demonstrates that the POWeR Tracker app is a feasible tool for engaging users in self-monitoring and behavioral changes related to weight management. The study could inspire the development of similar health apps or the enhancement of existing digital health interventions. The hybrid model (web-based and app-based) also introduces technological innovations that could be adapted to various health interventions.
Example: The combination of app and website provides a model for improving accessibility to digital health tools​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Behavioral and Social Change
Influence on Daily Habits: The study supports the hypothesis that frequent self-tracking and feedback via the app contribute to lasting behavioral changes. This potential for changing eating and lifestyle habits suggests that the research could have broad societal impacts in terms of reducing obesity rates and associated health costs​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Example: Users mentioned that the convenience of the app encouraged continuous self-monitoring and awareness of their health goals, which positively influenced their behavior​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy and Public Health Guidelines Influence
Informed Public Health Strategies: As digital health tools gain more recognition, the findings of this study can help shape policies related to digital health interventions, especially in preventative care. By providing evidence of the app's effectiveness, the research could encourage healthcare providers and policymakers to integrate digital tools into public health programs​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Example: Policymakers might adopt the hybrid intervention approach to enhance engagement in nationwide health campaigns focused on weight management​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Economic Impact
Cost Savings for Healthcare Systems: By promoting a scalable and effective digital solution for weight management, the research holds potential for reducing healthcare costs associated with obesity. This is particularly relevant for public health systems that face significant costs related to treating obesity-related conditions​(Research impact toolkit).
Example: Implementing digital health interventions can reduce the need for more expensive, in-person care options, leading to cost savings for both patients and healthcare providers​(impact pathway).
6. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Application and Scalability: The hybrid model presented in the study has relevance beyond the specific context of weight management. The intervention's success can be scaled up and adapted to other health-related behaviors, such as managing chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes or hypertension). The findings also have global applicability, especially in contexts where mobile phone access is prevalent but healthcare infrastructure may be lacking​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Example: The principles used in this study could be applied to similar health challenges globally, such as using mobile health technologies in developing countries​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Capacity Building and Skills Development
Empowering Users with Self-Management Skills: By focusing on self-monitoring and goal-setting via the app, the research contributes to individuals’ capacity to manage their health autonomously. This builds a foundation for individuals to maintain healthy behaviors even after the intervention ends, promoting long-term self-efficacy​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Example: The app encourages users to develop personal accountability and self-regulation, empowering them to sustain healthier behaviors independently​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Academic Knowledge Advancement
Expanding Knowledge on Digital Interventions: This study adds to the growing body of literature on the effectiveness of digital health interventions. It provides valuable insights into user engagement with hybrid digital health tools, which can influence future research on how to optimize app-based health interventions for various conditions​(Common Research Impact …).
Example: Researchers can build on this work to explore how different populations interact with digital health tools, potentially leading to new discoveries in health technology adoption​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Privacy and Ethical Use of Data: The use of digital health interventions often raises questions about data security and privacy. This study provides a framework for implementing these tools ethically, ensuring that user data is protected and used responsibly​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Sustainability and Long-term Impact
Sustainable Health Behavior Changes: The study demonstrates that the hybrid model has the potential for long-term use and sustainability. By integrating into users' daily lives through accessible technology, the app can facilitate sustained behavioral changes, leading to lasting health improvements​(Common Research Impact …).
Example: The use of existing mobile technologies ensures that the intervention can be maintained over time without significant additional costs or infrastructure requirements​(Research impact toolkit).
These potential impacts highlight the broad relevance of this research, not only within the academic and health sectors but also across societal and technological domains
