I have reviewed the provided case study and the dimensions of research impact outlined in your additional document. Below is an analysis of the research impact dimensions based on the content of the study titled "Professional development, changes in teacher practice, and improvements in Indigenous students' educational performance: A case study from New Zealand."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt (Educational Domain): The study focuses on improving the educational achievement of New Zealand's Indigenous Māori students through the Te Kotahitanga professional development project. It highlights how teacher practices were transformed by implementing culturally responsive, relationship-based pedagogy, leading to improvements in student engagement and educational outcomes. The research contributes to understanding pedagogical practices that improve Indigenous student performance (page 694). Example: The research directly influences educational policies and practices in New Zealand, with a broader impact on improving Indigenous education systems in other countries facing similar disparities.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt (Long-term Impact): The study addresses sustainability by evaluating if improvements in teacher practices and Māori student outcomes, observed in Phase 3 schools (2004-2006), were maintained over time (2007-2009). It also examines whether the same improvements could be replicated in Phase 4 schools, suggesting the professional development program's long-term impact on the education system (page 695-696). Example: The long-term impact lies in the study's potential to form the foundation for future Indigenous education reforms in other regions, influencing both policy and pedagogy for years to come.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt (Direct Stakeholders): Key stakeholders include Māori students, educators, and school administrators. The project directly benefits teachers by providing them with tools and professional development to improve their teaching practices. Policymakers and education administrators are also stakeholders, as they implement the program at a system-wide level (page 696-697). Example: Māori students are the primary beneficiaries, as the research addresses disparities in their educational performance. Educators and policymakers also benefit by gaining insights into effective pedagogical strategies for Indigenous students.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt (Deep Impact): The research has a deep impact within the field of Indigenous education, fundamentally shifting how teachers approach culturally responsive teaching and challenging deficit thinking about Māori student capabilities. This depth is demonstrated through measurable improvements in student outcomes and teacher practice (page 696). Example: The depth of impact is seen in the sustained improvements in Māori student outcomes, demonstrating the study's ability to transform the educational environment for Indigenous students at a systemic level.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt (Scalability): The research evaluates whether the professional development model, successfully implemented in Phase 3 schools, can be scaled and applied to Phase 4 schools. The findings suggest that the model is scalable and transferable to different schools and potentially to other regions with similar educational disparities (page 698). Example: The Te Kotahitanga model can be transferred to educational settings in other countries with Indigenous populations, providing a scalable approach to improving student outcomes through culturally responsive teaching.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt (Innovation): The research introduces innovative pedagogical strategies that challenge traditional teaching methods. The emphasis on relationship-based pedagogy and rejecting deficit thinking represents a significant shift in how educators approach Māori student education (page 697). Example: The introduction of a culturally responsive, relationship-based pedagogy disrupts conventional teaching practices, particularly in Indigenous education, by empowering teachers to adopt new strategies that improve engagement and achievement.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt (Sustainability): The research explores the sustainability of improvements in teacher practice and Māori student outcomes over several years (2007-2009). The study suggests that for sustained impact, continuous support through professional development and systemic changes in school policies are necessary (page 696-698). Example: The study emphasizes the ethical responsibility of ensuring that improvements in Māori student education are not short-lived but are sustained through ongoing support for teachers and schools.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt (Implementation): The study outlines a professional development cycle that includes classroom observations, feedback, and co-construction meetings to support teachers in implementing the Effective Teaching Profile (ETP). This structured approach ensures the usability and practical implementation of the research findings (page 698). Example: The Te Kotahitanga program's structured implementation model ensures that teachers can easily integrate the research findings into their daily teaching practices, leading to improved student outcomes.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt (Cross-disciplinary Relevance): While the study primarily addresses educational practices, its findings also have implications for social equity, cultural preservation, and policy reform. The cross-disciplinary nature of the research allows for its application in diverse sectors, including education, social sciences, and public policy (page 694-695). Example: The research's focus on culturally responsive teaching has global relevance, offering insights that can be applied to Indigenous education systems in other countries, making it a model for addressing educational disparities worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt (Adaptability): The research demonstrates adaptability by applying the professional development model to different schools (Phase 3 and Phase 4), showing that the program can be adjusted to meet the unique needs of various educational settings (page 698). Example: The Te Kotahitanga model's adaptability ensures it can be implemented in diverse school environments, making it resilient to changes in educational policy or school structure while maintaining its core focus on improving Indigenous student outcomes.

This assessment covers the key research impact dimensions from the case study and shows how the findings contribute to long-term educational reform for Indigenous students.
