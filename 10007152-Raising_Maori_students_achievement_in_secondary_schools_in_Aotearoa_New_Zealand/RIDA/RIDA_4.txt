Here is a detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions based on the study you provided, using the framework for evaluating research impact across multiple dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpts: "The development of culturally responsive pedagogy in classrooms has led to measurable improvements in Māori students' academic achievements. The program aimed to increase the number of students attaining national qualification standards and succeeded in improving literacy and engagement." (Results, page 42).
Example: This research primarily impacts the educational domain by transforming classroom practices and improving student outcomes. It also indirectly affects the social domain by promoting equity in education and addressing historical disparities in Māori student achievement.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts: "The observation tool developed for this initiative provided ongoing professional development for teachers. Over several years, it resulted in a sustained improvement in teaching quality and student engagement, particularly in schools that were part of the program for the longest period." (Results, page 42).
Example: This research shows long-term impact by embedding culturally responsive pedagogy into schools, creating a lasting improvement in teaching practices and educational outcomes, particularly for marginalized students.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpts: "Māori students and their teachers are the primary beneficiaries of this culturally responsive pedagogy program. It creates a feedback loop between teachers and students to improve engagement and learning." (Discussion, page 38).
Example: The direct stakeholders are the Māori students who benefit from improved education outcomes, while indirect stakeholders include educational policymakers who can use these findings to design similar programs nationwide.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: "The project not only had a deep impact within individual classrooms but also promoted broad system-wide changes in how culturally responsive pedagogy is understood and implemented." (Discussion, page 42).
Example: Deep impact was achieved in individual schools through enhanced teaching strategies, while broad impact occurred across the educational sector by influencing national policies aimed at reducing disparities in education.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: "The observation tool and professional development model could be easily adapted and applied to other educational settings beyond the initial pilot schools, providing a scalable solution to improving student engagement across diverse contexts." (Methods, page 38).
Example: The tool is both scalable—applicable to a large number of schools—and transferable, as it can be adapted to various educational systems, particularly in multicultural settings where student diversity is a factor.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: "The introduction of this culturally responsive pedagogy and the use of classroom observations represent a significant innovation in the field of teacher professional development." (Methods, page 38).
Example: The research disrupts traditional top-down methods of teacher evaluation by shifting towards collaborative feedback between teachers and observers, encouraging more responsive teaching practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: "The program supports long-term sustainability by fostering equity in education and addressing disparities in Māori student outcomes, promoting a fair and just educational environment." (Discussion, page 38).
Example: Ethical considerations are central to the research, as it directly addresses systemic inequities in the education system and seeks to provide sustainable solutions for marginalized groups.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: "The observation tool was specifically designed to be user-friendly, allowing teachers to easily adopt it into their daily practices, thereby ensuring its usability and immediate impact in the classroom." (Methods, page 39).
Example: The research offers a practical, easy-to-implement solution that teachers can integrate into their everyday routines, making it highly usable in real-world educational settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: "While the tool was developed for the New Zealand context, it has broader implications for other multicultural education systems worldwide, particularly those seeking to address disparities among indigenous populations." (Discussion, page 38).
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance, integrating educational theory, cultural studies, and policy. Its global relevance lies in its applicability to indigenous education systems worldwide, promoting equity in various cultural contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: "The iterative development of the tool, based on feedback and observed outcomes, demonstrates its adaptability to different classroom environments and teacher needs." (Discussion, page 40).
Example: The tool's resilience is evident in its ability to evolve based on user feedback, making it adaptable to various educational challenges and ensuring its long-term applicability.
