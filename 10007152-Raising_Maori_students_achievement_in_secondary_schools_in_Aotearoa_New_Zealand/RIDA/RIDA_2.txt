Here is an analysis of the provided study based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study addresses educational justice for refugee students by challenging mainstream educational discourses that fail to adequately support the unique needs of refugees in schools. It advocates for more equitable representation, redistribution, and recognition within the school and beyond, addressing the educational and cultural domains (Pages 198-200).
It also explores the social domain by discussing how mainstream education policies exclude the specific learning and emotional needs of refugee students (Page 198).
Example: The research impacts both educational and social domains by encouraging the development of policies and teaching practices that are more inclusive of refugee students' unique backgrounds and needs.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The findings are likely to generate long-term impacts on educational policy by highlighting the inadequacies of current educational frameworks and the need for sustained resources for refugee education. The study’s approach to interrogating dominant educational discourses contributes to a more profound shift in educational justice over time (Page 200).
Example: Over the long term, the research could influence future educational policies, especially in countries with large refugee populations, potentially transforming how refugee education is supported and funded.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Direct stakeholders include educators, policymakers, and refugee students, while indirect stakeholders are the broader community and future generations of refugee students who may benefit from improved educational equity and access (Pages 198-202).
Example: Refugee students directly benefit from more tailored educational approaches, while educators gain insights into addressing cultural and social injustices within their teaching practices.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

Deep impact is evident within the educational domain, where the study proposes new ways of thinking about refugee education that challenge mainstream educational practices.
Broad impact may occur across social and policy domains, influencing how educational policies are formed to consider the diverse needs of refugee students (Pages 200-202).
Example: The study deeply influences educational practices at the school level, while also broadly affecting educational policies and discourses on refugee inclusion.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The study’s findings are transferable to other educational settings, particularly in countries dealing with refugee populations. Its critical examination of mainstream policies and practices can inform broader educational reform (Page 202).
Example: The practices explored in this study could be adapted in other countries with similar challenges in integrating refugee students, thereby influencing global educational standards for refugee populations.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research is disruptive in that it challenges the dominant discourses within education that fail to address the specific needs of refugees. It pushes for a more inclusive approach, which could fundamentally change how educational justice is perceived and implemented (Page 200).
Example: By challenging mainstream educational frameworks, the study promotes innovative approaches to refugee education that disrupt traditional methods and advocate for equity and inclusion.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study emphasizes ethical considerations in ensuring that refugee students are not marginalized by educational policies. It also highlights the sustainability of educational programs that take into account the social and emotional well-being of refugee students (Pages 198-200).
Example: The research advocates for sustainable educational practices that are both ethical and inclusive, ensuring long-term support for marginalized students in education.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The study highlights practical approaches for educators to address inequities in refugee education, such as employing culturally representative staff and adapting teaching methods to better meet refugee students’ needs (Pages 200-202).
Example: Schools can implement these findings by adapting their hiring practices and developing more inclusive teaching strategies, which are directly usable in similar educational settings.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

Although focused on education, the study has cross-disciplinary relevance, particularly in the fields of social justice, migration studies, and policy reform. It also holds global relevance given the international nature of refugee crises (Pages 198-202).
Example: The research could inform international discussions on refugee education, influencing policies at a global level in countries facing large influxes of refugees.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The study advocates for educational systems that are more adaptive and resilient to the changing needs of refugee populations. This is crucial in addressing the complex social and emotional challenges faced by these students (Page 200).
Example: By promoting flexible and adaptive educational practices, the research helps create systems that are resilient to the evolving needs of refugee students and the challenges they face.

These dimensions illustrate the comprehensive impact of the study across multiple sectors, emphasizing its potential for broad and long-lasting change in refugee education.
