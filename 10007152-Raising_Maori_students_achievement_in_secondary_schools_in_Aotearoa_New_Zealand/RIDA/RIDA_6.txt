Based on the study you provided and the predefined dimensions of research impact, here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Employing Culturally Responsive Pedagogy to Foster Literacy Learning in Schools" by Janice Wearmouth.

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpt: "It is important to adopt pedagogy that is responsive to, and respectful of, them as culturally situated...school literacy learning for all students is to be as successful as it might be." (Introduction, page 2)

Domain: Educational and Social domains.
Example: This study directly impacts the educational domain by advocating for changes in literacy pedagogy to accommodate cultural diversity in schools, potentially reshaping curriculum design and teacher training programs. It also influences the social domain by addressing the societal need for inclusivity in education, fostering better social integration and reducing cultural barriers in learning environments.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: "This paper therefore discusses implications for policy and practice at whole-school, classroom, and individual student levels of culturally responsive pedagogy based on sociocultural understandings of the learning process." (Introduction, page 1)

Short-term Impact: The immediate adoption of culturally responsive teaching practices in diverse classrooms.
Long-term Impact: Over time, this study could lead to shifts in educational policies and the broader adoption of inclusive educational frameworks, potentially influencing teacher education and professional development for decades.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt: "The agency of the teacher as a mediator of learning who needs to acknowledge the learner’s cultural situatedness if school literacy learning for all students is to be as successful as it might be." (Page 2)

Direct Stakeholders: Teachers and educational institutions that will use the research to develop more culturally inclusive curricula and teaching methods.
Indirect Stakeholders: Students from diverse cultural backgrounds, policymakers involved in educational reform, and communities benefiting from improved educational outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: "This paper adopts a sociocultural lens through which to view such pedagogy and refers to a number of seminal texts to justify its relevance." (Introduction, page 1)

Deep Impact: The study deeply impacts the field of educational theory by advocating for a shift in how literacy is taught, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to one that is culturally responsive.
Broad Impact: The research has the potential to influence educational policies across various cultural and national contexts, with implications for educational psychology, social policy, and teacher training programs globally.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: "This paper discusses implications for policy and practice at whole-school, classroom, and individual student levels..." (Page 2)

Scalability: The research can be scaled from individual classrooms to entire school systems, as the culturally responsive pedagogy framework can be implemented on a large scale in diverse educational environments.
Transferability: This model of culturally responsive pedagogy could be adapted for other educational settings globally, especially in multicultural or multi-ethnic societies. It could also be applied to other areas of education, such as science or mathematics teaching.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: "It is important to recognise the legitimacy of literacy as a social practice as well as an individual attribute." (Introduction, page 2)

Innovation: The research introduces the concept of literacy as a socially constructed practice, encouraging educators to rethink traditional teaching methods and adopt more culturally inclusive approaches.
Disruption: This research has the potential to disrupt traditional literacy education models by replacing them with a pedagogy that integrates students' cultural backgrounds into the learning process, which could lead to broader changes in educational curricula and assessment methods.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: "Teachers need to create a means to mediate students’ own cultural contexts and the school cultural context..." (Page 5)

Sustainability: The research promotes long-term sustainability in education by advocating for teaching methods that are adaptable to diverse cultural contexts, ensuring that education systems remain inclusive as demographics evolve.
Ethical Considerations: By focusing on inclusivity and cultural responsiveness, the research addresses ethical issues related to equality in education, ensuring that all students, regardless of cultural background, have access to high-quality literacy instruction.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: "The degree to which teachers-as-mediators of literacy are sensitive and responsive to students’ existing culturally based literacy-related frames of reference can be highly significant." (Page 4)

Usability: The research is highly usable for teachers and educators, providing practical strategies for implementing culturally responsive pedagogy in diverse classrooms. The focus on teacher agency makes the findings immediately applicable in classroom settings.
Implementation: It can be implemented at various levels—whole-school, classroom, and individual student levels—making it a flexible framework for educators at different stages of their careers or in different educational settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: "The paper discusses implications for policy and practice at whole-school, classroom and individual student levels of culturally responsive pedagogy..." (Page 1)

Global Relevance: The research is relevant globally, especially in countries with significant cultural diversity. It has the potential to influence educational practices in multicultural societies and inform international educational policies.
Cross-disciplinary Impact: Beyond education, this research could influence disciplines such as sociology, cultural studies, and public policy, where issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity are also central concerns.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: "The role of the more skilled adult or peer mediators working in this zone is thus to support students to participate in activities in which they are as yet unable to participate on their own." (Page 4)

Resilience: The framework encourages resilience in education systems by promoting flexibility and adaptability to different cultural contexts. It supports the development of more robust and inclusive literacy programs that can withstand demographic changes.
Adaptability: The pedagogical model is highly adaptable, allowing it to be tailored to various cultural settings and educational levels, making it resilient to changes in student populations and educational standards.
This assessment shows that the research has a broad and deep impact across multiple dimensions, influencing not only the educational domain but also social and policy sectors, with significant implications for sustainability, scalability, and innovation.
