Impact Example: The techniques could lead to a paradigm shift in forensic science, where digital enhancements play a more dominant role than previously thought​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Cultural Impact:
The study may contribute to changing perceptions about the reliability of facial composites in criminal justice. As the public becomes more aware of improved suspect identification methods, there may be a cultural shift towards increased trust in forensic tools and the criminal justice system.

Impact Example: Public trust in law enforcement practices could improve as citizens see the adoption of more accurate, scientifically-backed forensic tools​(impact pathway).
9. Cross-disciplinary Impact:
This research bridges the fields of forensic psychology, criminal justice, and computer science (in relation to facial recognition technologies). This cross-disciplinary relevance could foster collaborations between researchers in these fields, leading to further innovations in facial composite construction and memory-based suspect identification.

Impact Example: Collaborative research between psychologists, software developers, and law enforcement agencies could lead to new breakthroughs in AI-powered facial recognition systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
10. Scalability and Transferability:
The techniques explored in this study can be scaled to other regions or countries, allowing law enforcement agencies worldwide to adopt enhanced composite creation methods. Moreover, these techniques are transferable to other areas of facial recognition, such as border security, private investigations, and AI-based facial recognition technologies.

Impact Example: These techniques can be adapted for global law enforcement use, with implications for international policing and security​(impact pathway).
11. Equity and Inclusivity:
Improved suspect identification through enhanced facial composites could lead to fairer judicial outcomes, particularly in cases involving marginalized communities, where traditional composite techniques may have been less effective.

Impact Example: By increasing the accuracy of facial composites, this research could help reduce biases in suspect identification, promoting more equitable justice processes​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Implementation and Usability:
The research findings are highly implementable in real-world settings. The enhanced techniques can be easily integrated into existing composite tools used by police forces, such as the E-FIT system.

Impact Example: Law enforcement agencies can quickly adopt these methods to improve their existing forensic processes without requiring extensive new infrastructure​(Research Impact Knowled…).
13. Ethical and Legal Considerations:
While enhancing facial composite recognition, the study raises ethical considerations regarding the potential for misidentification. Addressing these concerns is crucial to ensure that improved techniques do not lead to higher false-positive identification rates, which could result in wrongful accusations.

Impact Example: This research could inform the development of ethical guidelines for the use of enhanced facial composites, ensuring that the justice system uses these tools responsibly​(Research impact toolkit).
Conclusion:
The study presents a variety of potential research impacts spanning academic, societal, technological, and economic dimensions, along with considerations for policy change, equity, and ethical practices.
