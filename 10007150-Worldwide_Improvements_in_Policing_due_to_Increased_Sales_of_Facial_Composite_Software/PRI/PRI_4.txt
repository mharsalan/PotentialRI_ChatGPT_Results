10. Scalability and Transferability
The algorithms and systems developed in this study are highly scalable to other law enforcement agencies and potentially transferable to different domains such as security and entertainment. As these systems require minimal adaptation to different evolutionary operators, they can be easily implemented in various fields.

Example: The system could be scaled to national and international policing agencies and transferred to entertainment sectors, such as in character development for movies or games​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Implementation and Usability
The study improves the usability of facial composite systems, as the robustness of the interactive systems to different search spaces and operators simplifies their implementation across varying forensic departments. Law enforcement officers with different levels of technical expertise can use these systems effectively.

Example: Forensic departments across different countries can adopt these systems without extensive retraining​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Policy Influence
This research may also influence policymaking, particularly in the field of criminal justice. Policymakers may adopt guidelines based on this research to standardize the use of interactive evolutionary algorithms in facial composite systems, improving the fairness and accuracy of suspect identification processes.

Example: National law enforcement agencies might draft new policies that require the integration of such advanced forensic technologies, thereby standardizing forensic methods across regions​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
13. Ethical Considerations
This research touches upon ethical aspects, especially in ensuring that facial composite systems do not introduce bias, such as racial profiling, through the use of interactive algorithms. The study suggests pathways to ensure fair and equitable application of forensic technologies.

Example: Forensic tools designed from this research could include safeguards against biases that disproportionately affect marginalized communities​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
In summary, this study has far-reaching potential impacts across academic, societal, technological, and economic domains, with significant implications for law enforcement, forensic technology, and public trust in the justice system. It contributes not only to scientific knowledge but also to practical applications that enhance social welfare, criminal justice, and global policing practices.
