Based on the provided text, I will analyze the research paper titled "Interactive evolutionary generation of facial composites for locating suspects in criminal investigations" (Solomon et al., 2013) using the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions. Here is a detailed breakdown of each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Here we describe an alternative use for appearance models, namely for producing facial composite images... a system based on our approach, called EFIT-V, is used frequently by three quarters of UK police constabularies." (Introduction, p. 1). Page Reference: Introduction, page 1. Example: The research impacts law enforcement by providing a new tool (EFIT-V) that is used by police to generate facial composites, aiding criminal investigations. The domain primarily affected is law enforcement and public safety, with potential ripple effects in criminal psychology and forensic technology.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The EFIT-V system has been refined and developed over the years... the system continues to be adopted by police forces across the UK and other countries." (Discussion, p. 6). Page Reference: Discussion, page 6. Example: This research has long-term impact, as the EFIT-V system has continued to evolve and remains in use, impacting law enforcement over an extended period. Its ability to refine facial composite technology indicates enduring contributions to criminal investigations.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The system is used by over 60% of UKâ€™s police forces and is employed in other countries such as the USA and Canada" (Section 4, p. 5). Page Reference: Section 4, page 5. Example: The direct stakeholders are law enforcement agencies (police forces in the UK and internationally). Indirect stakeholders include the public, who benefit from improved criminal investigation methods, and criminal justice professionals who utilize the system to identify suspects.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Conceived originally as a research system operating under the name EigenFIT... EFIT-V combines a parametric model of facial appearance with an interactive evolutionary search within the parametric space." (Introduction, p. 2). Page Reference: Introduction, page 2. Example: This research has deep impact within the field of criminal investigations and forensic technology by advancing methods for generating facial composites. Its breadth includes potential applications in psychology, AI, and facial recognition systems, influencing multiple fields.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"The EFIT-V system... represents the first viable composite system to combine full-color face imagery with an interactive mechanism... deployed widely across police forces" (Section 5, p. 6). Page Reference: Section 5, page 6. Example: The scalability of EFIT-V is evidenced by its widespread adoption across police forces in various countries. Transferability is also high, as the system's use in criminal investigations could be adapted for use in other fields such as facial recognition technology in airports, security, or even private sector use.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"The use of an interactive evolutionary algorithm is a novel approach in facial composite systems." (Section 3, p. 4). Page Reference: Section 3, page 4. Example: The research represents a significant innovation in the field by integrating evolutionary algorithms into facial composite generation. This innovation is disruptive as it replaces older methods, like Identikit, with a more dynamic and accurate system, fundamentally changing the way criminal investigations are conducted.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"We describe the importance of accuracy in facial composite generation and ensuring witness memory is not distorted." (Discussion, p. 6). Page Reference: Discussion, page 6. Example: The research addresses ethical concerns related to witness memory, ensuring that the technology used does not distort or mislead memory recall. Sustainability is also inherent in the system's continued refinement and usage, making it a long-term tool for law enforcement.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The system was designed to be simple and accessible, reducing cognitive overload for the witness and making the process user-friendly for both witnesses and police operators." (Section 4, p. 5). Page Reference: Section 4, page 5. Example: Usability is a central focus of the research, as EFIT-V's design ensures it is easy to use for police and witnesses. Its straightforward interface supports rapid adoption, leading to its implementation in over 60% of UK police forces and globally.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"In both cases, the composite image was constructed by a trained operator... in accordance with guidelines set by the Association of Chief Police Officers" (Section 4, p. 5). Page Reference: Section 4, page 5. Example: The research has global relevance, influencing law enforcement practices not only in the UK but also internationally (e.g., USA, Canada). Cross-disciplinary relevance includes applications in psychology (memory and facial recognition) and AI (interactive algorithms).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The system has evolved over time, incorporating user feedback and technological advancements to improve performance." (Discussion, p. 6). Page Reference: Discussion, page 6. Example: The adaptability of EFIT-V is demonstrated by its ongoing improvements and updates. The system's resilience ensures that it remains effective in changing technological and investigative environments, making it a robust tool for future use.
This research contributes significantly across various dimensions, making it a valuable asset in law enforcement and forensic technology.
