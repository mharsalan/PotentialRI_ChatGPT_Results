I have gone through both the research paper and relevant material on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact." Based on these, I will now map the research findings onto the 10 dimensions. For each dimension, I will include relevant excerpts from the research paper and provide practical examples as per the provided criteria.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The paper's primary focus is on the communicative abilities of non-native English speakers (NNS) and how their interaction in English varies across contexts, particularly in non-standard or "English as a Lingua Franca" (ELF) settings. This impacts the academic domain, contributing to fields such as applied linguistics and second-language acquisition (SLA) research (p. 15).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 15.
Example:

The research enhances the understanding of how English is used differently in ELF contexts, providing new insights into language testing and assessment for non-native speakers, influencing language education practices and policies globally.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The findings have long-term implications by challenging the standardization of English testing, which could lead to paradigm shifts in how language proficiency is assessed over time, moving away from native-speaker benchmarks (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

This study could gradually reshape the design of English language proficiency tests over the next few decades, impacting academic testing bodies such as IELTS and TOEFL.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

Direct stakeholders include educators, linguists, and language assessment bodies who may benefit from this research by adapting their testing frameworks. Indirectly, it benefits students and NNS learners who seek more context-relevant language proficiency validation (p. 15).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 15.
Example:

English testing organizations (e.g., TOEFL) could directly adopt these findings to create fairer assessments for global test-takers, improving language learning outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research demonstrates deep impact in the specific field of language assessment, as it calls for rethinking conventional language testing norms, specifically those grounded in native-speaker accuracy (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

This depth of impact would revolutionize the way linguistic proficiency is evaluated, by influencing the global language assessment community to adopt more inclusive standards.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The approach of assessing proficiency based on context-sensitive usage of English (rather than native accuracy) shows high scalability for various educational and governmental institutions globally. It can also be transferred to other languages used in lingua franca contexts (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

The findings can be applied not only to English assessments but could be adapted to other globally-used languages, such as French and Spanish, thus scaling across multiple educational systems.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The paper challenges traditional language teaching and testing paradigms by proposing a shift towards context-sensitive assessments, making it a potentially disruptive force in the language testing industry (p. 15-16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Pages 15-16.
Example:

Adoption of the suggested testing models could disrupt long-standing international language assessments like IELTS and TOEFL by introducing more flexible, learner-centered evaluations.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study advocates for fairer language testing, aligning with ethical considerations by reducing biases against non-native speakers and ensuring inclusivity in global education systems (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

Ethical improvements to standardized language testing would ensure that language education promotes equity by focusing on learners' communicative competence in real-world settings, not native-like accuracy.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The proposed shift in testing (focusing on practical English usage in specific contexts) has strong usability for immediate adoption by testing organizations and educational institutions worldwide (p. 15-16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Pages 15-16.
Example:

Language testing bodies could quickly adapt their tests to incorporate more context-sensitive criteria, making the research highly usable for institutions across different cultural settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research is globally relevant as it addresses a challenge faced by NNS in many different educational and professional contexts, making it applicable across disciplines such as education, linguistics, and public policy (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

Its findings could influence language policies and testing frameworks in various countries, providing a cross-disciplinary framework that combines linguistic theory, educational policy, and assessment practice.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

By advocating for language assessments that adapt to user-specific contexts, the research supports testing frameworks that can evolve with changing communicative needs, displaying resilience (p. 16).
Page Reference:

Discussion, Page 16.
Example:

As global communication evolves, the flexibility of context-driven testing ensures that this approach remains resilient and adaptable, supporting learners across various socio-cultural environments.
These findings align well with the provided research impact dimensions and underscore the significant potential this research has for reshaping global educational practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
