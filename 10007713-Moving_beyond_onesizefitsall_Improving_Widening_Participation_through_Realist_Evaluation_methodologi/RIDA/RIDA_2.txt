Based on the provided documents and guidelines, here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the attached study, "Exploring teachers' ontologies of English: Monolithic conceptions of grammar in a group of Chinese teachers" by Christopher J Hall and others:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study explores teachers’ sensitivity to both monolithic and plurilithic conceptions of English, focusing on grammar, lexis, and pronunciation. It emphasizes a shift in pedagogical approaches to accommodate a more usage-based view of language (Results, page 88).
The research aims to inform teacher development, highlighting the need for reflective practices that align with the plurilithic reality of global Englishes (Discussion, page 91).
Example:

This research directly impacts the educational domain by influencing how English grammar is taught, particularly in non-native contexts like China. It encourages a shift from monolithic English to more diverse language practices in classrooms, which could reshape curricula and teaching methods in higher education.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study identifies that usage-based approaches to grammar could help teachers challenge the deficit view of language learning (Discussion, page 91).
It suggests that the adoption of plurilithic approaches to English may have long-term implications for teacher education and curriculum design in the context of global English (Discussion, page 92).
Example:

The long-term impact of this research lies in its potential to reshape how English is taught globally, especially in non-native English-speaking contexts like China. The findings could influence teacher training programs and standard curricula over the coming decades, promoting more adaptable and realistic language teaching practices.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study directly engages with university teachers of English in China, focusing on their conceptions of English and their role in transmitting these conceptions to learners (Participants, page 93).
The research also aims to engage applied linguists and teacher trainers by proposing practical approaches to address the diversity of English learners’ experiences (Discussion, page 89).
Example:

Direct stakeholders include Chinese English teachers, university students, and teacher training institutions. Indirect stakeholders involve applied linguists and educational policymakers who could adopt these findings to inform broader educational reforms.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study discusses how monolithic and plurilithic ontologies coexist in teachers' conceptions, particularly in teaching grammar versus other language components like lexis and pronunciation (Results, page 95).
It advocates for a more reflective and context-aware approach to teaching English, which could transform both theoretical and applied fields in ELT (Discussion, page 96).
Example:

This research has a deep impact within the field of English Language Teaching (ELT) by proposing a conceptual shift in teaching grammar. It also has broad implications across applied linguistics, teacher education, and curriculum development in non-native English-speaking countries.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The study’s findings could inform online resources and teacher development programs aimed at raising awareness of the complexity of English in a global context (Introduction, page 88).
The proposed plurilithic framework can be transferred to other non-native English-speaking contexts, particularly those with similar educational and linguistic challenges (Discussion, page 93).
Example:

Scalability: The framework could be scaled up to influence national educational policies in countries like China. Transferability: The concepts could be applied to other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, adapting to different cultural and linguistic realities.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The study challenges the traditional monolithic approach to English language teaching by promoting a plurilithic view that reflects the diverse realities of English use in global contexts (Introduction, page 88).
It introduces innovative pedagogical approaches that could disrupt traditional methods of teaching English grammar, moving away from prescriptive norms towards more dynamic, usage-based practices (Results, page 89).
Example:

The research has the potential to disrupt traditional English language teaching methods by replacing the rigid, monolithic conception of English with a more flexible, plurilithic framework. This shift could fundamentally change how grammar is taught and assessed.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study discusses how monolithic conceptions of English reinforce deficit views of language learning, which may not align with the diverse needs of learners in globalized contexts (Discussion, page 91).
It advocates for a more inclusive approach that recognizes and values linguistic diversity, thus contributing to more equitable language teaching practices (Discussion, page 92).
Example:

This research promotes ethical considerations in language education by challenging the inherent bias of monolithic English standards. It fosters a more inclusive and sustainable approach to teaching English, catering to diverse learner needs.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The study’s findings are intended to inform the development of practical teacher development resources that can be implemented in classrooms and teacher training programs (Results, page 88).
It suggests practical ways for teachers to reconcile monolithic and plurilithic views of English in their teaching practices (Discussion, page 92).
Example:

The research is usable in teacher training programs and can be directly implemented in ELT curricula. It offers practical tools for educators to adopt more flexible approaches to teaching grammar, lexis, and pronunciation.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research highlights how monolithic conceptions of English grammar may not be appropriate in a world where English functions as a global lingua franca (Introduction, page 88).
It connects insights from applied linguistics, educational theory, and global English studies to propose a plurilithic framework for teaching English (Discussion, page 91).
Example:

The study is cross-disciplinary, drawing on applied linguistics and educational theory, and has global relevance for English teachers and policymakers in diverse linguistic contexts around the world.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research explores how teachers can adapt their teaching practices to better reflect the plurilithic reality of English, thereby increasing their resilience in changing educational contexts (Results, page 95).
It suggests that usage-based approaches to grammar can help teachers become more adaptable in diverse teaching and learning environments (Discussion, page 91).
Example:

By promoting a flexible, plurilithic approach to English teaching, this research fosters resilience and adaptability in educators, enabling them to meet the evolving needs of learners in a globalized world.
