I have reviewed the attached research article and the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact." Below is a detailed analysis of the study based on the dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The study focuses on "plurilithic views of English," critiquing the dominant "monolithic views" in applied linguistics, and argues for a more cognitive-oriented understanding. The research impacts several domains:
Academic Domain: It challenges existing linguistic frameworks and contributes new insights to the intersection of cognitive and applied linguistics, potentially advancing academic discourse across linguistics, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguistics.
Educational Domain: The findings have implications for English Language Teaching (ELT) practices, suggesting a reappraisal of how language proficiency is defined and assessed.
Social Domain: By addressing the inequalities arising from monolithic views of language, the research could influence social understandings of language diversity and multilingualism.
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, pages 1–4; Discussion, pages 18–20.
Example:

The research enhances the understanding of linguistic diversity, potentially influencing educational policy and practices in language education, especially in contexts involving multilingual learners.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The research proposes a shift from traditional views of language to a cognitive, plurilithic perspective. This long-term paradigm shift has potential lasting impacts on language teaching, policy development, and linguistic theory.
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, pages 16–21.
Example:

Long-term, this work could serve as a foundation for future research in cognitive linguistics and influence language education policies, reshaping how languages are taught in multilingual settings.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The primary stakeholders include:
Researchers in applied and theoretical linguistics who can build on the cognitive-linguistic framework.
Educators and Language Policy Makers who can use these insights to design more inclusive curricula and assessment standards.
Learners of English, particularly those from non-native or marginalized backgrounds, who could benefit from more flexible language proficiency standards.
Page Reference and Section:

Methods and Implications, pages 14–16.
Example:

Language educators might apply this research to rethink how they approach teaching English, adopting more inclusive strategies that cater to diverse language backgrounds.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research makes a deep impact within linguistics, especially in the subfields of cognitive and applied linguistics. It has broad implications across education, policy, and social science by addressing linguistic diversity and multilingualism.
Page Reference and Section:

Results and Discussion, pages 12–18.
Example:

Deep impact: The critique of monolithic language models could lead to a fundamental change in linguistic theory.
Broad impact: The framework proposed could be applied in fields such as education and public policy, influencing language curricula and testing.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The theoretical framework proposed for plurilithic views of English can be transferred to other languages, making it adaptable for different linguistic and educational contexts. Its scalability is evident in its potential application across different regions and educational levels.
Page Reference and Section:

Implications, pages 16–20.
Example:

Transferability: This framework can be adapted to other language learning environments, particularly in multilingual regions.
Scalability: The research could be scaled to influence international language proficiency tests, like TOEFL or IELTS, by promoting a more inclusive approach.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research introduces a novel cognitive approach to understanding language diversity, challenging the traditional monolithic frameworks that dominate applied linguistics. This has disruptive potential in fields like language teaching and assessment.
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction and Conclusion, pages 2–4, 19–21.
Example:

Innovation: Proposes a new cognitive-linguistic framework that integrates plurilithic perspectives, innovating how we understand language use and learning.
Disruption: Challenges the current standards of language teaching and assessment, potentially disrupting traditional models of language proficiency.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The research promotes linguistic diversity and inclusivity, advocating for more ethical approaches to language teaching that recognize non-standard varieties of English. This supports social sustainability by fostering more equitable language policies.
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, pages 18–20.
Example:

The study encourages sustainable language policies that recognize and respect linguistic diversity, potentially impacting international educational frameworks and language rights.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The cognitive framework presented can be practically implemented in ELT curricula and assessment standards, providing a more accurate reflection of learners' language abilities.
Page Reference and Section:

Methods and Implications, pages 16–18.
Example:

Educators could implement these insights in developing language tests that accommodate plurilithic views of language, ensuring fairer assessments of English learners.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The study's insights have global relevance, especially in regions where English is used as a second or foreign language. Cross-disciplinary relevance extends to education, psychology, and sociolinguistics.
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction and Results, pages 3–12.
Example:

Globally, the research could influence language policy in multilingual countries, shaping educational approaches and language assessment tools in diverse contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The framework’s adaptability to different linguistic and cultural contexts suggests that it is resilient and can withstand changes in language policy and education reforms.
Page Reference and Section:

Conclusion, pages 20–21.
Example:

The adaptability of the proposed framework ensures its relevance in both current and future linguistic and educational challenges, making it a robust tool for evolving language policies.
