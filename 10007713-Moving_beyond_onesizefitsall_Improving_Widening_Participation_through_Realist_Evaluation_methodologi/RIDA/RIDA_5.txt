To assess the research impact dimensions for the study titled Educators’ beliefs about English and languages beyond English: From ideology to ontology and back again by Christopher J Hall and Clare Cunningham, I will provide a detailed analysis across the top 10 dimensions of research impact based on the content available in the document:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: "We explore the relationship between ideological and ontological beliefs about language(s) and argue that the ontological dimension has been overlooked in previous work on educator ideologies." (Introduction, p.1)
The study contributes to the educational domain by influencing teacher education and development regarding language beliefs and practices, especially related to English as an Additional Language (EAL). It also impacts social and policy domains by addressing how ideological beliefs in language education shape societal power structures and national identity narratives.
Example: This research impacts teacher education policies by advocating for ontological reflection, potentially altering how educators approach multilingualism in classrooms.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: "The study concludes by addressing how ideological reflection and ontological deconstruction can potentially be used in teacher development programs..." (Conclusion, p.6)
Example: This study is likely to have both short-term impacts by informing immediate changes in teacher professional development and long-term impacts through sustained shifts in educational ideologies over time, influencing future generations of teachers and students.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: "We argue for introducing ontological reflection in teacher education..." (Discussion, p.4)
Example: The primary stakeholders include educators (both teachers and teacher trainers), policy makers in education, and students, particularly those categorized as EAL. Indirect stakeholders could be broader educational institutions and communities impacted by more inclusive language education practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: "Our analysis suggests a pervasive hegemonic ideological belief, consistent with the ‘monolingual habitus’..." (Results, p.3)
Example: The research has a deep impact in the field of educational linguistics by challenging entrenched ideologies around language use in schools. Its broad impact extends to social policy by questioning how educational practices reflect wider societal beliefs about language and national identity.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: "The process of ontological interpretation can be used in teacher development programmes to allow educators to understand and reassess their own ideologies..." (Methods, p.5)
Example: This research is transferable to different educational contexts, especially in multilingual societies. It is also scalable in that its findings could inform national and international teacher training programs aimed at improving educational outcomes for multilingual students.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: "We propose that careful analysis of educators’ ontological beliefs can shed light on how potentially harmful ideological beliefs persist in educational systems." (Introduction, p.1)
Example: The study is disruptive in that it challenges traditional views of language use in education, particularly the dominance of monolingual ideologies, advocating for a more inclusive and reflective approach to language education.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: "We address how ideological reflection can empower educators to challenge the unhelpful and entrenched beliefs about language perpetuated in nationalist discourses..." (Conclusion, p.6)
Example: The research promotes ethical considerations by advocating for more equitable language practices in education, particularly for students who speak languages other than English. It also contributes to the sustainability of inclusive educational environments.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: "Our study has practical implications for teacher development, encouraging educators to engage in critical reflection on their own language ideologies." (Discussion, p.5)
Example: This research has direct usability in teacher training programs, offering practical frameworks for educators to reflect on their language beliefs and practices.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: "This research offers insights that can be applied in a globalized context where English plays a hegemonic role in many education systems." (Introduction, p.2)
Example: The study’s global relevance lies in its application to multilingual education contexts worldwide, particularly in nations where English is taught as a second language. Its cross-disciplinary relevance includes education, linguistics, and sociology.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: "Our findings suggest that educators can resist unhelpful narratives by engaging in reflective practice." (Conclusion, p.6)
Example: The research promotes resilience by equipping educators with tools to adapt to changing linguistic landscapes in classrooms, fostering more inclusive and adaptable teaching practices over time.
This assessment highlights the multifaceted impact of the study on various research dimensions, particularly in education, policy, and societal domains.
