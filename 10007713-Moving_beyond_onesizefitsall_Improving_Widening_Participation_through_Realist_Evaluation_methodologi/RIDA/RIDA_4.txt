I have reviewed the documents, and based on the information from the research paper and the detailed structure for assessing research impact dimensions, I will now outline the key findings from the study titled "Investigating the lexico-grammatical resources of a non-native user of English" by Christopher J. Hall, Jack Joyce, and Chris Robson, mapped against the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research examines the lexico-grammatical resources, specifically the "can you/could you" construction in email requests from a non-native English speaker. It impacts linguistics, second language acquisition (SLA), and language teaching pedagogy by challenging traditional views on English grammar as monolithic and proposing a "plurilithic" grammar model.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 36; Results, p. 44.
Example: This study influences the academic domain, particularly in linguistics and language pedagogy. It could affect TESOL practices by encouraging teachers to recognize the diversity of learner grammars instead of holding learners to native speaker norms.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research contributes to ongoing discussions in linguistics and SLA about the variability of second language grammars and usage-based models of learning, potentially influencing future studies on idiolects and learner grammars.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 45-47.
Example: This work has a long-term impact by contributing to foundational knowledge in SLA, particularly in understanding how lexico-grammatical patterns develop in individual learners over time.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: Stakeholders include researchers in linguistics and second language acquisition, TESOL educators, and policymakers involved in language education reforms. The research benefits these groups by offering new insights into how non-native speakers use grammar and how this should be reflected in teaching methods.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 37; Conclusion, p. 47.
Example: TESOL educators can use the findings to adjust their teaching approaches, focusing on the diversity of learner grammars rather than aiming for native-like accuracy.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The depth of the research lies in its detailed analysis of a specific grammatical structure ("can you/could you" requests), contributing deeply to theoretical models in usage-based linguistics. Its breadth extends to the potential applications in language teaching and cross-linguistic studies.
Page Reference: Methods, p. 41-43; Results, p. 44.
Example: The deep impact is in advancing SLA theory by showcasing how individual learners' grammars evolve. The broader impact lies in influencing language teaching methodologies globally, particularly in ESL contexts.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research’s focus on individual learner grammars has potential transferability to other areas of SLA research, such as cross-linguistic comparisons of learners from different linguistic backgrounds.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 47.
Example: The findings could be transferred to studies on how speakers of other languages acquire specific grammatical constructions in English, providing insights into teaching approaches across diverse language groups.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study disrupts traditional SLA models that view grammar learning as a progression toward native speaker norms, introducing an innovative view of learner grammars as plurilithic and shaped by individual experiences.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 37; Discussion, p. 47.
Example: This disruptive potential challenges how SLA research and language teaching view "correct" grammar, shifting the focus toward more personalized, learner-centered approaches.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study encourages a more inclusive, ethical approach to language teaching by valuing learner diversity and moving away from deficit models that judge learners by native speaker standards.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 36; Conclusion, p. 47.
Example: Ethically, the study supports a sustainable approach to language teaching that respects and values the linguistic resources learners bring to the classroom.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research’s findings can be implemented in TESOL curricula and teacher training programs, influencing how grammar is taught in diverse classroom settings.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 47.
Example: Language educators can use the study's insights to create more flexible, student-centered grammar teaching approaches that recognize individual learner differences.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study’s insights into the development of non-native grammars are relevant across multiple fields, including applied linguistics, cognitive science, and educational psychology. Its focus on English as a global lingua franca gives it broad relevance.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 36; Conclusion, p. 47.
Example: The research is globally relevant, particularly in regions where English is taught as a second language, offering cross-disciplinary insights into language learning and usage.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research demonstrates resilience by adapting existing SLA theories to account for plurilithic grammars, proposing new frameworks that can accommodate diverse learner experiences.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 47.
Example: The adaptability of the study’s findings allows for broader application across various learner contexts, making it relevant for ongoing changes in language teaching practices worldwide.

This mapping illustrates how the study contributes to various dimensions of research impact, with significant implications for both academic theory and practical application in language education.
