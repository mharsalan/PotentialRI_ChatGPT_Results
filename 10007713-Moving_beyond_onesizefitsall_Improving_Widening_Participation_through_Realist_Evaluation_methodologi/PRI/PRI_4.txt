Based on the study titled "Investigating the lexico-grammatical resources of a non-native user of English," authored by Christopher J. Hall, Jack Joyce, and Chris Robson, here are the potential research impacts organized by different types of impact dimensions. The detailed analysis aligns with the predefined research impact dimensions and knowledge from the relevant sources.

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Linguistic Theories: This study advances the understanding of "plurilithic" grammar models, challenging traditional "monolithic" views of English grammar. It deepens knowledge in applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA).

Impact: Influences academic discourse on language variability and supports new frameworks in SLA research​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Example: This theoretical contribution could inform future research on how individual learners develop their unique linguistic systems.
Cross-disciplinary Research: The study touches on intersections between cognitive linguistics, educational psychology, and language pedagogy.

Impact: Promotes interdisciplinary research, particularly between linguistics and language education, benefiting educators and curriculum designers​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development: Insights from this research can be applied to developing TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) curricula, advocating for a shift from native-speaker standards to recognizing individual learner grammars.

Impact: Enhances teaching methods by valuing diverse linguistic backgrounds and promoting inclusivity in language classrooms​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Teacher Training: The findings can inform teacher training programs by highlighting the importance of recognizing plurilithic grammars and moving away from rigid grammatical correctness based on native norms.

Impact: Increases the effectiveness of language instruction, fostering more adaptive teaching strategies that cater to the individual needs of learners​(impact pathway).
3. Societal and Cultural Impact
Linguistic Diversity and Inclusion: By challenging the norm of native-speaker grammar, the research promotes greater acceptance of linguistic diversity. This can influence societal attitudes towards non-native English speakers, reducing linguistic prejudice and promoting a more inclusive society.

Impact: Cultural shift towards embracing diverse language competencies in educational and social settings​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Behavioral Change in Language Learning: Encouraging learners and educators to embrace the plurilithic approach can lead to changes in how language learning is perceived, focusing on communication effectiveness rather than strict adherence to native norms.

Impact: Contributes to positive changes in language learning behaviors, fostering confidence among learners​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Impact
Language Education Policy: The study's findings may influence language education policies, particularly in multicultural and multilingual societies where language diversity is prominent.
Impact: Could lead to the development of policies that support more inclusive language teaching practices, accommodating non-native English speakers in various educational settings​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Technological and Innovation Impact
Development of Learning Technologies: The study’s insights on grammar usage can be applied to the development of adaptive language learning technologies, such as AI-based tools that customize learning experiences based on the user’s unique linguistic profile.
Impact: Promotes technological innovations in educational tools, helping non-native speakers improve language proficiency through personalized learning​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Health and Well-being Impact
Psychological Impact on Learners: By recognizing the legitimacy of learner grammars, this research could positively impact learners' mental health by reducing anxiety related to language learning, especially among non-native speakers.
Impact: Improves the well-being of learners by fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
7. Economic Impact
TESOL Industry Growth: The adoption of more inclusive and adaptive TESOL teaching methods can lead to the growth of language education industries globally, catering to diverse learner needs.
Impact: Supports the economic expansion of educational sectors, including language schools, online platforms, and language testing services​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Ethical Language Teaching: The study advocates for ethical teaching practices that respect the linguistic diversity of learners, challenging deficit-based models that marginalize non-native English speakers.
Impact: Promotes sustainable educational practices that foster long-term social equality and ethical inclusivity​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
9. Global Relevance
International Application: The findings have relevance for global English language teaching, especially in countries where English is taught as a second or foreign language.
Impact: Influences English language teaching policies and practices worldwide, with a particular focus on diverse learner populations in non-native English-speaking countries​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Adaptation to Emerging Trends in Education: This study offers a flexible approach to language teaching that can adapt to future trends, such as increased digital learning and the rise of English as a global lingua franca.
Impact: Ensures the resilience of language teaching methodologies in adapting to changing educational landscapes and societal needs​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These impacts highlight the far-reaching potential of the study in contributing to academic discourse, societal attitudes, educational practices, and policy development while promoting inclusivity and innovation in language education.
