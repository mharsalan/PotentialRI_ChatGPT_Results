Based on the detailed analysis of the study you shared and the predefined categories from research impact dimensions, I will outline the specific potential research impacts for the study on non-native English speakers’ communicative abilities in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) contexts. These impacts are categorized according to the various types of impact dimensions from academic, social, and practical perspectives.

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: The study contributes to a deeper understanding of language usage in ELF contexts, expanding the theoretical frameworks in applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA). It challenges the native-speaker benchmark used in language testing, influencing academic discourse around proficiency assessment.

Impact Example: This research could reshape curricula and teaching methodologies in linguistics departments globally by emphasizing functional communicative ability over native-speaker norms​(Research impact toolkit).
Cross-disciplinary Influence: Although rooted in linguistics, the study's implications extend to areas like educational psychology, communication studies, and globalization research. Scholars across disciplines that deal with cross-cultural communication can leverage the findings.

Impact Example: Future research in global business communication or intercultural competence could apply these findings to understand how non-native speakers navigate international work environments​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Shaping Language Policy: The findings advocate for more inclusive language proficiency testing standards, which could inform language policy at international testing bodies such as IELTS and TOEFL. These bodies may shift from accuracy-based testing toward communicative competence​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

Impact Example: Education ministries in non-native English-speaking countries might revise their English language education policies to align with these communicative competence-based frameworks.
Cultural Inclusivity: The study addresses the biases inherent in current English language assessments, promoting cultural inclusivity. It highlights the challenges faced by non-native English speakers, who often use English in international and multicultural contexts.

Impact Example: It can lead to cultural shifts in language education practices by encouraging more equitable learning environments that appreciate the diverse ways English is used globally​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Policy Impact
Influence on Global Testing Frameworks: The research findings could inform revisions of global testing standards. Educational bodies could adjust their frameworks to better accommodate ELF contexts, influencing international testing policies.
Impact Example: Policymakers in educational boards and government agencies may adopt these findings to revise national and international English proficiency assessments, promoting fairer evaluations​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Practical and Educational Impact
Improving Language Learning Materials: The study's findings can inform the development of educational tools and materials designed for English learners in non-native settings, which focus on effective communication rather than achieving native-like accuracy.

Impact Example: Language learning platforms could redesign their content to reflect ELF principles, making these tools more practical for learners who need English for specific real-world interactions, such as in business or travel​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Teacher Training and Development: The research provides significant insights for English language teachers, enabling them to adopt more context-sensitive teaching methods that focus on students' communicative effectiveness in diverse situations.

Impact Example: Teacher training programs could use these insights to equip educators with skills to prioritize real-world communication, particularly in multilingual classrooms​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Technological and Pedagogical Innovation
Innovation in Language Assessment: The study’s advocacy for functional, context-based language assessments might spur innovation in assessment tools. Digital platforms and apps designed to test communication skills rather than linguistic accuracy could emerge, creating technological advancements in language learning software​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Impact Example: Online testing platforms could develop more dynamic and real-time assessments that adapt to the user’s situational language needs, revolutionizing how English proficiency is measured.
6. International Collaboration and Diplomatic Impact
Promotion of Global Cooperation in Language Education: The research’s focus on ELF contexts underscores the importance of collaborative language education policies across nations where English serves as a bridge language. It fosters greater understanding and cooperation among countries that rely on English as a common communicative tool.
Impact Example: The study could lead to international agreements on education standards, facilitating smoother collaboration between countries in higher education, trade, and diplomacy​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Health and Well-being Impact (Indirect)
Reduction of Language-Induced Stress: By advocating for more accessible and realistic language proficiency assessments, the research could help reduce test anxiety and stress associated with rigid, unrealistic language proficiency standards. This has implications for mental health, particularly for students and professionals who need English for career progression.
Impact Example: Institutions could develop more supportive learning environments that reduce test-related stress, enhancing the well-being of learners globally​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Equity and Inclusivity
Promoting Language Equity: This study challenges the dominance of native-speaker norms and fosters linguistic equity. It highlights the need for language assessments that reflect the real-world communication skills of non-native speakers, reducing discrimination and promoting inclusivity.
Impact Example: Institutions could adopt inclusive testing practices that reflect the diversity of English usage across the globe, helping to close the achievement gap between native and non-native speakers​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Ethical Language Education: The study aligns with ethical considerations by promoting fairness in language testing. It questions the ethicality of judging non-native speakers by native-speaker standards and pushes for ethically justifiable assessment systems that reflect real-world communication.
Impact Example: The findings might inspire educational institutions to develop language assessments that are ethically aligned with global linguistic diversity, promoting fairness in academic and professional settings​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Public Awareness and Communication
Raising Awareness of ELF Usage: By highlighting the prevalence and importance of ELF, the study contributes to raising public awareness about the variety of English used worldwide, which may help reshape public attitudes towards non-native English speakers.
Impact Example: Public outreach campaigns or media features could highlight these findings, helping shift societal attitudes toward a more inclusive understanding of English usage globally​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
In conclusion, the research study on ELF and non-native English speakers has multi-faceted potential impacts, ranging from academic contributions to reshaping global language assessment policies, advancing technological innovations in language testing, promoting inclusivity and fairness in educational systems, and enhancing international collaboration.
