After thoroughly analyzing the study and reviewing the various types of research impact frameworks, here are the potential research impacts of the study based on the different types of impacts discussed in research literature:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge and Frameworks: The study introduces and advances the idea of plurilithic views in English language teaching (ELT), challenging traditional monolithic perspectives in linguistics. This contribution can spur further theoretical and empirical research in the fields of applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive linguistics, influencing subsequent academic inquiries.

Impact Example: Future academic works can build on this study to develop new frameworks for understanding linguistic diversity and cognition in language acquisition and pedagogy​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

2. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development and Language Pedagogy: By critiquing the dominant approaches in ELT and advocating for plurilithic views of language, this study could reshape language education curricula. It encourages educators to adopt more inclusive teaching methods that accommodate linguistic diversity and cognitive differences among learners.

Impact Example: ELT programs globally may revise their curricula to incorporate a more inclusive approach to language proficiency, reflecting cognitive and sociolinguistic diversity​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

3. Social and Cultural Impact
Promotion of Linguistic Diversity: The study highlights the sociocultural dimensions of language learning and proficiency, promoting a shift toward accepting and integrating diverse linguistic forms. This has the potential to reduce language-related inequalities and challenge the dominance of standardized forms of English in educational and social contexts.

Impact Example: The research can influence language policy in multicultural societies, encouraging more inclusive language use in public institutions and media, which could reduce the social stigma against non-standard English varieties​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

4. Policy Impact
Influence on Language Education Policies: By critiquing current monolithic views of English and proposing alternative frameworks, the study could shape national and international language policies. Policymakers may incorporate findings from the research into guidelines for language assessment, teaching standards, and immigration language requirements.

Impact Example: Policymakers might revise standardized language proficiency tests (like TOEFL or IELTS) to better reflect the plurilithic nature of English and accommodate diverse linguistic backgrounds​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

5. Health and Well-being Impact
Impact on Mental Health and Language Identity: The study’s focus on plurilithic perspectives can indirectly affect learners’ mental health by promoting more inclusive language-learning environments. Reducing the pressure to conform to monolithic standards can lead to better self-esteem and cultural identity preservation among non-native speakers.

Impact Example: By fostering linguistic inclusivity, this research could reduce anxiety and identity conflicts for English learners, improving overall psychological well-being​(Research impact toolkit).

6. Economic Impact
Improvement of Language Testing and Assessment Industries: The findings may lead to the creation of more flexible language assessment tools that accommodate linguistic diversity. This could open up opportunities for businesses in the educational technology sector to develop new testing software or assessment platforms that reflect these insights.

Impact Example: Companies specializing in language testing may see increased demand for customized assessments that cater to diverse language communities​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Environmental Impact
Indirect Impact through Educational Sustainability: By promoting more inclusive and flexible language teaching methods, the research supports sustainable educational practices. These practices can be adapted to diverse educational environments, particularly in developing regions where traditional language proficiency models may not be applicable.

Impact Example: The research can contribute to the sustainability of language education systems by enabling context-specific, adaptable teaching methods, which reduce the need for rigid standardization​(Research impact toolkit).

8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Integration Across Disciplines: The cognitive approach to language diversity proposed by this study has implications for various disciplines, including education, psychology, and cultural studies. Its global relevance is especially strong in multilingual societies where English is a second language.

Impact Example: Research on plurilithic views could be applied to cross-disciplinary studies on cognitive diversity, informing global educational strategies in diverse, multilingual settings​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

9. Scalability and Transferability
Global Applicability of the Framework: The study’s insights can be scaled across various geographic regions and educational levels, particularly in settings with multilingual learners. The plurilithic perspective can be transferred to other languages and regions, making it a valuable tool for education systems worldwide.

Impact Example: The cognitive framework for plurilithic language understanding can be applied across different languages and educational systems, from local community schools to international institutions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

10. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Disruption of Traditional Language Teaching: The study introduces a new cognitive-based framework for language teaching that challenges conventional language models. This has the potential to disrupt the standardized language teaching industry, leading to more innovative approaches in language education and assessment.

Impact Example: The study can disrupt traditional ELT paradigms by promoting a more flexible, learner-centered approach, encouraging innovation in educational technology and language learning platforms​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

11. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Foundational Contribution to Linguistics: The study’s cognitive approach to language diversity contributes to the theoretical advancement of applied and cognitive linguistics. It lays the groundwork for future scientific progress in understanding the relationships between cognition and language learning.

Impact Example: Future studies in psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics can build upon this research to further explore the cognitive aspects of language acquisition and multilingualism​(Research Impact Knowled…).

12. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness on Linguistic Diversity: The research can raise public awareness about the importance of linguistic inclusivity and the complexity of language learning. Through public dissemination, the study could inform debates on language education and multilingualism, particularly in multilingual societies.

Impact Example: The study could be used to promote public campaigns on the value of diverse English varieties, leading to greater cultural acceptance and reduced linguistic discrimination​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

Conclusion:
The study's comprehensive critique of monolithic views of English and its proposition for a plurilithic framework have far-reaching potential impacts across academic, social, educational, economic, and policy domains. It not only advances theoretical understanding in linguistics but also offers practical solutions for addressing linguistic diversity in education and society. Its impacts are scalable, transferable, and disruptive, with broad global relevance.
