Based on the attached paper titled "Clinical pathways for patients with newly diagnosed hepatitis C – What actually happens"​(1), I have extracted the relevant research impact dimensions. Below is a detailed analysis of each dimension as per the guidelines from your instructions​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study provides insight into the healthcare domain by examining the referral pathways for hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and their subsequent care management. It highlights the gaps in healthcare systems, focusing on how patients diagnosed with HCV in different settings (prisons, primary care, drug and alcohol units) are referred—or not referred—for further specialist care (Results, page 266)​(1).
Example: This research impacts the healthcare domain by identifying critical gaps in the care of HCV patients, which can inform improvements in patient referral systems, ultimately improving treatment outcomes and preventing progression to severe liver disease.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study identifies systemic issues that have persisted over a long period (e.g., over two years of tracking patient data), which suggests that the findings could contribute to long-term healthcare policy improvements aimed at increasing referrals and improving care pathways for HCV patients (Discussion, page 268)​(1).
Example: This research could have long-term impacts by influencing future healthcare policies that streamline patient referral processes, thereby increasing treatment access for those diagnosed with HCV.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders impacted by this research include healthcare providers (GPs, specialist clinics), policymakers, and patients diagnosed with HCV. It sheds light on how primary care systems, correctional facilities, and specialist clinics manage HCV referrals (Methods and Results, page 265-267)​(1).
Example: Direct stakeholders include primary healthcare providers who may need to improve communication and follow-up protocols for HCV patients. Indirect stakeholders include patients who benefit from improved care pathways that reduce delays in treatment.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The depth of the study is evident in its detailed analysis of HCV referral patterns within a local healthcare system. The breadth is demonstrated by its potential to influence other regions or health systems with similar care management issues (Discussion, page 270)​(1).
Example: The depth of the research lies in its thorough exploration of patient dropout rates from referral pathways. Its breadth can extend to healthcare systems globally, as the findings about systemic healthcare inefficiencies can apply in various national contexts.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings regarding referral inefficiencies can be scaled beyond the study's Nottingham setting to inform national or even global strategies for managing HCV patient care pathways (Discussion, page 270)​(1).
Example: This study's methodology and findings could be transferred to other regions or countries facing similar issues in patient management for chronic conditions like HCV, and the recommendations could be scaled to improve healthcare outcomes on a larger scale.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: While the study does not introduce disruptive innovations, it highlights gaps that, when addressed, could innovate the care management process for HCV by ensuring that more patients receive the care they need in a timely manner (Discussion, page 270)​(1).
Example: The study could lead to innovative healthcare practices by prompting the adoption of automated referral systems, ensuring that HCV patients are consistently followed up and directed to appropriate care.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study indirectly touches on sustainability by advocating for improvements in patient care pathways that, if implemented, could result in long-term health benefits and resource efficiency within the healthcare system (Discussion, page 270)​(1).
Example: By improving patient referral systems, the research supports sustainability in healthcare by ensuring that resources are used effectively, reducing the need for more intensive interventions like liver transplants due to untreated HCV progression.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research offers practical insights into the failures of the current referral system and provides data that could directly inform the implementation of more effective healthcare strategies for managing HCV (Discussion, page 270)​(1).
Example: Healthcare policymakers and administrators can implement changes in referral systems based on the study's findings, ensuring better usability of the referral processes to improve patient outcomes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While primarily focused on the healthcare system, the study has potential cross-disciplinary relevance in areas such as public health, epidemiology, and healthcare administration, as well as global relevance given the worldwide burden of HCV (Introduction, page 264)​(1).
Example: The research findings could transfer to global health contexts, helping to shape public health initiatives aimed at improving HCV care pathways in various healthcare systems globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study emphasizes the need for the healthcare system to adapt by ensuring better communication and tracking systems for HCV patients, highlighting a failure in adaptability in the current system (Results and Discussion, page 268)​(1).
Example: This research advocates for a more resilient healthcare system that can adapt to patient needs by ensuring that referral and follow-up processes are robust and fail-proof.
Each of these dimensions reflects how the study's findings can contribute to improving healthcare practices, influencing policy, and impacting both patients and healthcare providers across multiple sectors.
