Based on the detailed reading of the study "Cost‐effectiveness of the HepCATT intervention in specialist drug clinics to improve case‐finding and engagement with HCV treatment for people who inject drugs in England", I have identified the potential research impacts across various dimensions. Below is an in-depth list aligned with common research impact dimensions:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
Impact: The study demonstrates significant improvements in public health outcomes by enhancing hepatitis C virus (HCV) case-finding and treatment in people who inject drugs (PWID). It could lead to a reduction in HCV infections, improved engagement in treatment, and consequently lower HCV-related mortality and morbidity among this high-risk group.
Example: The intervention can prevent 75 deaths and reduce the incidence of new infections by 51% over 50 years, thus improving overall health in vulnerable populations.
2. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
Impact: The cost-effectiveness analysis shows that implementing the HepCATT intervention could save healthcare systems significant costs by reducing HCV transmission and the long-term need for expensive treatments of advanced liver diseases.
Example: Scaling the intervention nationally in England could cost £8.8 million but lead to significant savings in healthcare costs through reduced treatment expenses over time​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Social and Cultural Impact
Impact: By addressing stigma associated with HCV among PWID, the study contributes to societal awareness of the healthcare needs of marginalized populations. It may also influence public discourse on harm reduction and healthcare inclusivity.
Example: The study encourages a shift in how society and healthcare providers approach drug-related health issues, promoting a more inclusive, health-focused model rather than stigmatization​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Impact: The findings of the study can inform policymakers and healthcare planners on effective strategies for HCV elimination. The intervention's proven effectiveness may advocate for more widespread implementation of similar models in public health policies.
Example: The intervention could guide national HCV elimination strategies, aligning with the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of reducing HCV as a public health threat by 2030​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Impact: The HepCATT model has high potential for scalability across other regions and healthcare settings, not only in England but in other countries dealing with similar HCV challenges. It could also be transferred to other infectious diseases where case-finding in hard-to-reach populations is critical.
Example: If successful, the intervention could be adapted to other public health challenges, such as HIV or tuberculosis (TB) case-finding in high-risk communities, demonstrating transferability to other diseases and contexts​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Impact: By embedding HCV case-finding within drug treatment centres, the HepCATT intervention introduces an innovative approach to disease control, disrupting traditional healthcare models that often fail to reach high-risk populations like PWID.
Example: This approach shifts the healthcare model from reactive to proactive, facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment, which can revolutionize how chronic infectious diseases are managed in marginalized communities​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Duration of Research Impact
Impact: The intervention demonstrates both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it will lead to an immediate reduction in HCV infections among PWID. Over the long term, it contributes to sustained reductions in HCV-related morbidity and mortality, as well as healthcare cost savings.
Example: The long-term modeling of a 50-year impact period illustrates the sustained health benefits and potential for systemic healthcare improvements​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Impact: This research directly benefits multiple stakeholders, including PWID, healthcare providers, drug treatment centres, and policymakers. Indirectly, the public also benefits from reduced HCV transmission and the social burden of untreated chronic infections.
Example: Policymakers and public health authorities can use these findings to develop more inclusive healthcare strategies that address the needs of underserved populations​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
9. Technological Advancement and Clinical Practice Improvement
Impact: This study proposes improvements in clinical practice by integrating nurse facilitators into drug treatment centres, leading to enhanced engagement with healthcare services among PWID, a group typically hard to reach through conventional healthcare settings.
Example: This could set a new standard for treating infectious diseases in high-risk populations, improving healthcare delivery models​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Equity and Inclusivity
Impact: By focusing on PWID, a marginalized and often stigmatized group, the study promotes equity in healthcare. It highlights the importance of accessible, integrated healthcare services tailored to the needs of vulnerable populations.
Example: The intervention may reduce health disparities by ensuring that PWID have equitable access to life-saving treatments​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Public Awareness and Education
Impact: The study can help raise public awareness of HCV and its burden on PWID. It could also promote education initiatives within communities and healthcare systems to reduce stigma and improve treatment engagement.
Example: Public health campaigns based on the findings of this study could lead to more informed communities, better healthcare engagement, and improved health literacy around HCV prevention​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Environmental Impact and Sustainability
Impact: While not the primary focus, reducing the number of chronic HCV cases and subsequent liver transplants has an indirect environmental benefit by decreasing the long-term use of medical resources and reducing the carbon footprint associated with healthcare services.
Example: Fewer liver transplants and long-term care requirements contribute to sustainable healthcare delivery by optimizing resource use and reducing waste​(Common Research Impact …).
In summary, the study has profound potential research impacts across health, economics, social systems, public policy, and healthcare innovation, demonstrating both broad and deep societal relevance.
