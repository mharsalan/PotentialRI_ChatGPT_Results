The research study can be assessed across the following top 10 dimensions of research impact:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

The research contributes significantly across multiple domains:
Health: If the study includes health-related innovations or disease treatment advancements, it would affect healthcare systems and practices.
Environmental: Research on sustainable practices or the effects of climate change could influence environmental conservation efforts.
Technological: Any development of new technologies could affect industries like manufacturing or transportation.
Policy: If the research addresses public health or environmental regulations, it could inform new policies.
Example: Research in healthcare that develops a new cancer immunotherapy would change oncology practices and improve patient outcomes .
Duration of Research Impact:

This research could have both short-term and long-term impacts:
Short-term: Immediate policy implementations or technological adoptions could lead to quick societal changes.
Long-term: Foundational research, such as breakthroughs in understanding complex biological systems, could affect healthcare practices for decades.
Example: If the study involves technology like CRISPR, it would have long-term implications for genetic engineering and healthcare innovation .
Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):

Stakeholders range from researchers and industry professionals to policymakers and the public. For example:
Researchers: Further advancements in related fields.
Healthcare providers: Immediate improvements in clinical practices.
Policymakers: Long-term regulations shaped by research findings.
Example: A study on AI ethics could directly benefit tech developers and indirectly protect user privacy .
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Research could have a deep impact in one field, transforming fundamental understanding, or a broad impact across disciplines.
Example: Research in bioinformatics might deeply influence genetic research while also affecting computer science, biotechnology, and medical diagnostics .
Scalability and Transferability:

If the research findings can be scaled up or transferred to different contexts:
Scalability: From small pilot programs to nationwide implementations.
Transferability: Research findings in one field being applicable to another (e.g., AI applications in both finance and healthcare).
Example: Research on a low-cost desalination system could be scaled to help water-scarce regions globally .
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Research introducing new methods, technologies, or ideas has high innovation potential, while disruptive research could replace existing paradigms.
Example: The development of mRNA vaccines is both an innovative and disruptive breakthrough in medical science .
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

The research's contribution to sustainability (environmental, economic, or social) and alignment with ethical standards is key.
Example: A study on climate change mitigation technologies like carbon sequestration promotes environmental sustainability .
Implementation and Usability:

Research outcomes that are practical and easy to implement are more likely to have a broader impact.
Example: The usability of a new medical diagnostic tool in rural areas, where healthcare infrastructure is limited, would increase its impact .
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Research that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries and addresses global challenges holds strong cross-disciplinary relevance.
Example: Studies on global pandemics or climate change require the integration of insights from multiple fields (e.g., economics, health, and environmental science) .
Resilience and Adaptability:

The ability of the research to adapt to changing conditions and challenges ensures its continued relevance.
Example: Technological advancements that can evolve with new data or societal needs ensure lasting impact, such as AI algorithms that improve over time .
These dimensions reveal the multifaceted ways in which the research might impact various sectors and timeframes. The specific examples mentioned apply to research involving technology, healthcare, sustainability, and policy, among others.
