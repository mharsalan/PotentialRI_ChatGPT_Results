To assess the research impact dimensions based on the study provided in the attached PDF file (titled "Durs Grünbein and the Poetry of Science"), here is a detailed breakdown based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: "This chapter seeks to read Grünbein’s intense engagement with the natural sciences up to c. 1995 against the backdrop..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: The research primarily impacts the academic domain by exploring intersections between literature and science, offering insights into both poetic and scientific discourse. It contributes to both literary studies and the study of the science-literature nexus, influencing interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: "Korte also rightly insists on the tension between the sheer waywardness of groupings and impulses characterizing this most various and vigorous of poetic moments" (Page 71).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 71.
Example: The long-term impact of the study lies in shaping future interdisciplinary studies, providing a model for examining the intersection of arts and sciences in German poetry, which could influence literary analysis for decades.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: "It has often been pointed out that the late 1980s and 1990s saw a paradigm shift in German poetry" (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: Direct stakeholders include literary scholars and students studying 20th-century German poetry. Indirect stakeholders involve cultural historians and interdisciplinary researchers focusing on the role of science in the humanities.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: "This most various and vigorous of poetic moments..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 71.
Example: The study has deep impact within literary studies, particularly German poetry, and a broad impact in fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue between literature and the natural sciences.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: "Korte sees the rapprochement between the two spheres of knowledge (poetry and science) as one of the key developments of the 1990s" (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: This research has high transferability, as the methods for analyzing the relationship between poetry and science can be applied to other literary traditions and periods beyond German poetry.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: "The rise of the poeta doctus as the defining characteristic of these years..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: The study disrupts traditional approaches to literary analysis by incorporating scientific themes, contributing innovative insights into the role of science in modern poetry.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: "A scientific turn or cognitive turn marks a key development..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: Ethically, the study emphasizes the integration of diverse knowledge systems, promoting a more sustainable academic discourse that bridges the gap between arts and sciences.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: "Other critics have pointed out the level of abstraction and difficulty inherent in it..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 71.
Example: The study’s insights into poetry and science can be directly implemented in interdisciplinary curricula in literature departments, enhancing academic programs that focus on the relationship between the humanities and sciences.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: "The rapprochement between the two spheres of knowledge..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by linking literary criticism with scientific discourse, and its insights can be applied globally to studies of literature in other languages and cultures.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: "This chapter seeks to read Grünbein’s intense engagement with the natural sciences up to c. 1995..." (Page 71).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 71.
Example: The adaptability of this research lies in its potential to influence future studies that explore the ongoing interaction between literature and other fields, including digital humanities and technological innovations in art.
This detailed assessment provides a comprehensive view of the study's impact across multiple dimensions, highlighting its influence on academia, interdisciplinary research, and its potential for long-term relevance.
