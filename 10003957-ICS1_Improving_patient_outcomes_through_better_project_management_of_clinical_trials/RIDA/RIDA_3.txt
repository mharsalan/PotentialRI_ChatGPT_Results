Based on the content extracted from the document titled "Conditions of Success for Earned Value Analysis in Projects," I will now assess the Research Impact Dimensions based on your request and provide detailed dimensions as per predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Academic Impact: The study extends the literature on Earned Value Analysis (EVA) by focusing on empirical analysis through case studies in construction and clinical research. It contributes to the development of new theoretical frameworks incorporating agency theory and organizational justice theory.

Example: Scholars in project management and organizational behavior can use this framework to explore the effectiveness of EVA systems in different project environments.
Reference: Introduction, Pages 1-2.
Industry Impact: The study evaluates EVAâ€™s impact in practical, real-world industries such as airport terminal construction and clinical research, providing a model for tracking project progress, which can be adopted in other sectors.

Example: Companies in these industries can use EVA metrics to improve project tracking, reduce costs, and enhance collaboration between contractors and clients.
Reference: Case Studies, Pages 15-17.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Short-term Impact: EVA provides immediate benefits in project cost and schedule management, improving decision-making in real-time by offering early warning signals through its metrics (e.g., Cost Variance, Schedule Variance).
Example: Project managers can make swift adjustments based on EVA data to prevent delays and budget overruns.
Reference: Case Studies, Pages 15-19.
Long-term Impact: The proposed framework for the conditions of success of EVA will influence future projects by offering a structured approach to performance measurement and enhancing trust between stakeholders.
Example: The model may lead to the long-term adoption of EVA in multiple sectors, beyond construction and clinical research, encouraging continuous improvement in project monitoring systems.
Reference: Framework and Future Work, Pages 23-24.
3. Geographic Impact:
The research has global applicability, especially in industries that frequently rely on outsourced projects and need better mechanisms to monitor performance across different geographic regions.
Example: The EVA framework can be applied to international construction projects where multiple parties from different countries are involved, helping overcome the complexities of managing multinational teams.
Reference: Introduction, Pages 3-4.
4. Societal Impact:
The study has implications for improving transparency and accountability in project management, particularly in sectors like healthcare and infrastructure.
Example: The use of EVA in clinical trials (e.g., for haemophilia) ensures that public health initiatives are executed efficiently, potentially leading to faster and safer drug approvals.
Reference: Haemophilia Drug Trial Case Study, Pages 17-19.
5. Policy Impact:
The framework developed in this study can shape organizational policies around project monitoring and performance evaluation. It encourages organizations to adopt standardized metrics (like EVA) for better project governance.
Example: Government agencies overseeing large-scale infrastructure projects may incorporate EVA as a mandatory performance metric.
Reference: Conclusions, Pages 27-28.
6. Health and Well-being Impact:
By applying EVA in clinical research for drug trials, the study contributes to improving the efficiency and success rate of drug development, which directly impacts public health.
Example: Improved project tracking in clinical trials for haemophilia drugs leads to faster treatment availability and better outcomes for patients.
Reference: Clinical Research Case Study, Pages 17-18.
7. Technological and Methodological Impact:
The study contributes to the advancement of project management methodologies, offering a robust framework for integrating EVA with other performance metrics (e.g., fuzzy logic and risk-based approaches).
Example: Future projects may incorporate the proposed enhancements to EVA, such as dealing with uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations.
Reference: Methodology and Literature Review, Pages 8-12.
8. Capacity Building Impact:
The research emphasizes the importance of training and capacity building within organizations to ensure the effective use of EVA systems. This can lead to better human resource development in project management skills.
Example: Organizations may adopt more comprehensive training programs to educate project teams on EVA systems, improving overall project efficiency.
Reference: Cross-case Analysis, Pages 19-20.
9. Innovation Impact:
The study introduces an innovative approach by combining EVA with agency theory and organizational justice theory. This interdisciplinary framework enhances the predictive power and application of EVA in complex projects.
Example: Future project management tools may incorporate behavioral insights from organizational justice to improve contractor-client relationships.
Reference: Framework and Propositions, Pages 21-24.
10. Educational Impact:
The research contributes to educational resources in project management courses and professional training, offering a new case-based learning tool for understanding the conditions of success in EVA.
Example: Universities and training institutions may use this study as a case study for teaching real-world applications of EVA in different industries.
Reference: Case Studies and Practical Implications, Pages 15-19, 26-27.
