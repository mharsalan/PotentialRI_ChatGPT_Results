Based on the details from the document and the predefined research impact dimensions, here are the research impact dimensions for the attached study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
The study primarily impacts the academic domain by contributing to project management in clinical trials, focusing on improving efficiency in drug development processes through Product-Based Planning. Additionally, it has implications for the economic domain, as it addresses cost management in the pharmaceutical industry, and the health domain due to its relevance to the development of new drugs through clinical trials.

Academic Domain: The study enhances knowledge in operations management and clinical research project management, particularly by introducing a new framework for handling clinical trials. This can influence future academic work in project management, R&D in pharmaceuticals, and clinical trial methodologies.
Economic Domain: The focus on reducing costs in clinical trials has direct economic implications, especially for pharmaceutical companies looking to manage budgets more efficiently.
Health Domain: Since clinical trials are crucial for drug development, the study indirectly impacts patient care and treatment by promoting more efficient drug development processes.
