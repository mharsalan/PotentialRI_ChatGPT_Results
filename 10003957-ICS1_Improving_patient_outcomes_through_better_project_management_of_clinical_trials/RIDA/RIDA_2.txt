Based on the information from the uploaded document and predefined instructions, I can now provide the research impact dimensions in detail for the attached study.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Academic Domain: The study enhances the understanding of outsourcing clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry, specifically focusing on project management strategies like fixed-price and variable-priced contracts. This research influences academic discussions on operations management and the complexities of project management in clinical research.
Economic Domain: By examining the cost implications of outsourcing in clinical trials, the study has significant economic impact, particularly for pharmaceutical companies seeking to optimize costs through effective contracting strategies.
Health Domain: Given that clinical trials are essential for drug development, the research indirectly impacts the health domain by improving the management of trials, which can lead to more efficient and faster drug development, ultimately benefiting patients.
Example: Pharmaceutical companies can apply the study's findings to better manage costs and resources during drug trials, which could lead to faster drug approval and availability to the public.
