2. Duration of Research Impact:
Short-term Impact: The study’s findings are immediately applicable to ongoing projects where relational issues between contractors and clients are critical to success. It provides strategies to improve project performance quickly by resolving relational risks.
Example: Companies managing complex projects can integrate the proposed relational mechanisms to ensure project success within their current operations.
Reference: Results and Case Study, Pages 9-11.
Long-term Impact: The proposed framework could influence project management methodologies over time, potentially becoming part of standard practices in industries that rely on outsourcing.
Example: Over time, the CURED framework may be incorporated into standard project management certifications, influencing future project managers' education and professional practice.
Reference: Discussion and Future Research, Pages 18-19.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Direct Stakeholders: Project managers, contractors, and client organizations in the construction and clinical research industries directly benefit from improved project outcomes through better relationship management.
Example: Project managers can immediately apply the findings to enhance client-contractor collaboration, improving project success rates.
Reference: Stakeholder Involvement, Page 12.
Indirect Stakeholders: End users and patients in clinical trials indirectly benefit from successful project execution, leading to more timely and cost-effective delivery of results in drug trials.
Example: The improved efficiency in clinical trial management due to better relational risk management can result in faster drug development, benefiting patients.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Deep Impact: The study offers deep insights into the management of relational risks through agency theory, contributing significantly to the understanding of principal-agent relationships in complex projects.
Example: The CURED framework could deeply influence the way relational risks are perceived and managed in project management, particularly in outsourced projects.
Reference: Theoretical Contributions, Pages 4-5.
Broad Impact: The findings can be adapted across various industries where client-contractor relationships are pivotal, such as pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, and IT.
Example: The CURED framework can be adopted in industries like IT project management, where external vendors play a crucial role in delivering technological solutions.
Reference: Cross-Industry Relevance, Pages 16-18.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Scalability: The framework proposed can be scaled up for large-scale projects, such as national infrastructure programs or multinational clinical trials.
Example: The CURED framework could be used in managing large-scale construction projects, ensuring consistency in how relational risks are managed across multiple locations.
Reference: Case Study A (Airport Construction), Pages 13-14.
Transferability: It can be transferred to other sectors where similar relational risks exist between stakeholders, such as software development, transportation, and manufacturing.
Example: IT companies managing outsourced software development projects could adopt the framework to manage vendor relationships.
Reference: Transferability to Other Sectors, Pages 18-19.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Innovation: The introduction of a formalized framework (CURED) to manage client-contractor relationships is a novel contribution to project management literature and practice.
Example: This framework introduces new ways to address relational risks, providing structured approaches that can be integrated into existing project management tools.
Reference: Framework Introduction, Pages 5-7.
Disruption: The study challenges traditional views on project management, which tend to focus solely on technical performance metrics, by highlighting the importance of relational dynamics.
Example: In shifting focus towards the relational aspects of project management, the study could disrupt current industry practices, leading to a greater emphasis on collaboration over control.
Reference: Discussion on Shifting Project Management Practices, Pages 16-18.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Sustainability: The focus on ethical project management through trust-building and relationship management contributes to more sustainable, long-term collaborations between clients and contractors.
Example: By promoting transparency and trust in client-contractor relationships, the study encourages more ethical and sustainable business practices in project management.
Reference: Ethical Management, Pages 9-11.
Ethical Impact: The study promotes fairness by addressing agency problems like information asymmetry and opportunistic behavior, leading to more equitable outcomes for all stakeholders involved.
Example: Contractors will be encouraged to adopt more transparent practices, knowing that better relational management can lead to repeat business and trust from clients.
Reference: Ethical Considerations, Pages 12-13.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Usability: The study’s findings are highly actionable, offering a clear framework that can be immediately implemented in practice by project managers.
Example: The CURED framework is straightforward and practical, making it easy for project teams to adopt and apply across various project phases.
Reference: Implementation Guidelines, Pages 10-12.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Cross-Disciplinary Impact: The study’s framework can be applied to project management, organizational behavior, and business ethics disciplines.
Example: The framework could be used by organizational behavior scholars to study trust and collaboration in business settings, beyond project management.
Reference: Cross-disciplinary Applications, Pages 14-16.
Global Relevance: The research has global implications, particularly for industries where outsourcing and client-contractor relationships are critical.
Example: International organizations conducting cross-border projects can use the framework to manage relationships across different cultural and regulatory environments.
Reference: Global Relevance, Pages 17-19.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Resilience: The framework encourages adaptability by helping project teams to anticipate and manage relational risks, improving their ability to withstand project challenges.
Example: Organizations can use the framework to build more resilient relationships that can adapt to changes in project scope or unforeseen issues.
Reference: Resilience in Project Management, Pages 14-15.
In summary, this study aligns with multiple dimensions of research impact by offering both deep academic insights and broad practical applications across industries. Its innovative framework provides a new way to manage relational risks, promoting ethical, scalable, and adaptable practices that have the potential to influence both project management theory and practice globally.
