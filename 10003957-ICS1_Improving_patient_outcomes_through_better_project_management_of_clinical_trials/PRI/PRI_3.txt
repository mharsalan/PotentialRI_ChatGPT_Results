Based on the research impact frameworks and dimensions discussed across the provided documents, the research impact pathways for the study titled "Conditions of Success for Earned Value Analysis in Projects" can be elaborated in detail, covering both pre-publication and post-publication phases.

Pre-Publication Pathways
Stakeholder Engagement:

Engage with Industry Practitioners Early: Engaging key stakeholders in construction, clinical research, and project management sectors ensures that the study addresses their specific challenges with EVA (Earned Value Analysis). Feedback gathered from focus groups or consultations with industry professionals could help refine the study’s relevance and applicability​(3 (3)).
Collaboration with Experts: Collaborate with project management experts, contractors, and financial analysts to co-create the EVA framework. This collaboration will enrich the study with real-world insights and ensure that the research outcomes have direct applicability​(3 (3)).
Pilot Testing:

Implement EVA in Live Projects: Prior to publication, conducting pilot studies using the proposed EVA conditions of success framework in ongoing construction or clinical projects would help validate its efficacy. Real-world data can be collected to refine the framework and provide concrete examples​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Building Networks:

Establish Partnerships with Professional Bodies: Work closely with organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI) or the Association for Project Management (APM) to share preliminary findings, generating early interest in the framework and creating a pipeline for its adoption post-publication​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Present at Conferences: Preliminary results can be presented at key industry conferences or workshops such as construction project management forums or healthcare management conferences to build awareness of the study and its potential impact​(Research impact toolkit).
Post-Publication Pathways
Academic Dissemination:

Publication in Peer-Reviewed Journals: Publishing the final study in high-impact journals like Project Management Journal or International Journal of Project Management ensures that the research reaches academic audiences and influences further research in project performance evaluation​(3 (3)).
Citations and Academic Influence: Encouraging citations by participating in research forums and collaborating with universities for research projects. This expands the study’s academic reach, influencing curricula and future research on EVA and project management​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Industry Adoption:

Implementing EVA in Industry Standards: The EVA framework should be integrated into industry standards for project management. For example, construction firms and clinical trial managers can apply the framework to improve project tracking and decision-making processes​(3 (3)).
Training and Capacity Building: Developing training programs or certifications for project managers and industry professionals based on the study’s findings will enhance their skills in using EVA for effective project oversight​(Research impact toolkit).
Policy Influence:

Advocating for Policy Change: By engaging with policymakers in industries like construction and healthcare, the study can promote changes in project management guidelines that include EVA as a standard for performance measurement. Influencing government regulations around large-scale project accountability could be a significant pathway​(impact pathway).
Policy Briefings and Reports: Creating policy briefs summarizing the study’s recommendations for improved project governance through EVA will help shape both industry-specific regulations and general project management policies across sectors​(Common Research Impact …).
Global Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:

Cross-Sector and Cross-National Collaboration: The study’s framework can be shared with international project management organizations, helping to harmonize EVA practices globally. This increases the study’s transferability and scalability across industries and countries​(Common Research Impact …).
Workshops and Webinars: Hosting webinars or workshops aimed at project management professionals globally would help disseminate the findings and encourage the broader application of the EVA success conditions framework​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Commercialization and Technological Integration:

Developing Software Tools: The study’s findings could lead to the development of software tools that help automate EVA processes, integrating them into project management platforms like MS Project or Primavera. Commercializing such tools would further enhance the adoption of the research​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Licensing the Framework: Licensing the EVA success conditions framework to consulting firms or project management software providers allows the study’s findings to reach a wider market, creating economic impacts through job creation and improved project management services​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-Term Monitoring and Sustainability
Ongoing Evaluation:

Track Impact Metrics: After the framework’s implementation, companies and academic institutions should track the long-term impacts of EVA adoption. Metrics such as project cost savings, reduced delays, and improved stakeholder collaboration will provide measurable evidence of the study’s success​(Research impact toolkit).
Continuous Feedback: Establishing continuous feedback mechanisms between researchers and industry users ensures that the EVA framework remains relevant and can be refined as needed​(impact pathway).
Sustainability and Ethical Impact:

Encouraging Ethical Project Management: The integration of organizational justice theory in EVA promotes fairness and transparency in project dealings, contributing to ethical management practices. This will lead to more sustainable business relationships, reducing conflicts and promoting long-term cooperation between stakeholders​(3 (3)).
Resilience and Adaptability:

Adaptability to Different Industries: While the study focuses on construction and clinical research, the framework’s adaptability will allow it to influence other sectors, including IT, manufacturing, and logistics, enhancing project management in these fields​(Research impact toolkit).
Resilience in Changing Economic Conditions: By providing tools for better managing project risks and uncertainties, the study’s framework will help industries become more resilient in times of economic downturns or unforeseen disruptions like COVID-19​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conclusion
The research pathways for the EVA success conditions study span multiple dimensions—academic, industrial, policy, and societal. These pathways emphasize early stakeholder engagement, widespread dissemination of findings, adoption by industries and policymakers, and long-term monitoring to sustain impact. By following these detailed impact pathways, the study has the potential to drive substantial improvements in project management practices across various sectors globally.
