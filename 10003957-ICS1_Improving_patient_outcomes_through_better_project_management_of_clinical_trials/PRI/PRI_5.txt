The research impact pathways for the study titled "Resolving Agency Issues in Client-Contractor Relationships to Deliver Project Success" can be understood in terms of the different stages and strategies necessary to achieve the impacts discussed earlier. These pathways include actions both before and after publication, ensuring that the findings from this study translate into real-world changes and benefits.

Here’s a detailed exploration of the pathways:

Before Publication: Preparing and Laying the Foundation for Impact
Engagement with Stakeholders:

Early Consultation: Involve industry professionals, such as project managers, contractors, and clients in sectors like construction and clinical trials. This ensures that the study’s findings are grounded in the realities of these sectors.
Feedback Loops: Create focus groups or workshops with stakeholders to discuss agency theory, relational risks, and their experiences with client-contractor relationships. Their insights will refine the CURED framework.
Pilot Testing of the CURED Framework:

Case Applications: Before finalizing the study, apply the CURED framework in real-world pilot projects (e.g., construction or clinical trials) to assess its effectiveness in reducing relational risks and improving collaboration.
Data Collection and Refinement: Collect qualitative and quantitative data from these pilots to adjust the framework based on real-world performance. This will add robustness to the study and demonstrate its practical utility.
Academic and Industry Conferences:

Present initial findings at academic conferences (e.g., project management conferences) and industry-specific events (such as those related to construction management and pharmaceutical trials). Early presentations will build awareness and stimulate interest, ensuring that the study’s framework is considered by potential adopters.
Co-authoring with Practitioners:

Collaborative Research: Involve professionals from the industry as co-authors or contributors. This will increase the practical relevance of the study and build a network of industry champions for the CURED framework.
After Publication: Ensuring Real-World Adoption and Implementation
Dissemination in Targeted Channels:

Academic Journals: Publish the findings in journals related to project management, construction, and clinical research (e.g., Project Management Journal, International Journal of Project Management). These journals will ensure that the framework reaches researchers who can build on it further.
Industry Publications: Disseminate the findings through industry-specific publications, such as Outsourcing-Pharma or Construction Week. This will help project managers and industry leaders adopt the CURED framework.
Workshops and Training Programs:

Training for Project Managers: Develop and offer training programs based on the CURED framework for professionals in sectors that rely on client-contractor relationships (e.g., construction, healthcare). These programs can be integrated into professional certification programs (such as PMI certifications).
Capacity Building: Host workshops for industry professionals, focusing on relational risk management and the application of agency theory in project management.
Policy Advocacy and Standards Development:

Policy Briefs: Prepare policy briefs for government bodies, regulators, and industry associations that manage large-scale projects (such as infrastructure projects or national healthcare programs). Highlight the benefits of incorporating the CURED framework into their standard project governance processes.
Integration into Project Management Standards: Collaborate with organizations like the ISO or PMI to integrate relational risk management principles from the CURED framework into project management standards.
Technological Integration:

Project Management Software Tools: Work with software developers to integrate the CURED framework into project management software like Primavera or Microsoft Project. Features could include dashboards that track relational risks and contractor performance, allowing project managers to identify and mitigate issues early.
Commercialization of Tools: Develop digital tools or consulting services based on the framework. These could be used by companies to audit and improve their client-contractor relationships.
Ongoing Monitoring and Feedback Loops:

Establish Monitoring Systems: After publication, set up systems to monitor the long-term impact of the CURED framework. This could involve periodic surveys or studies that track how companies are implementing the framework and its effects on project success.
Continuous Improvement: Based on feedback from companies and project managers, refine the framework to ensure it remains relevant and adaptable to changing project environments.
Long-term Sustained Impact
Global Adoption:

International Application: Given the framework’s adaptability across industries, promote its adoption in global markets, particularly in countries where client-contractor relationships are critical (e.g., in large-scale infrastructure projects or cross-border clinical trials).
Collaboration with Multinational Organizations: Collaborate with international organizations (e.g., the World Bank, OECD) to include the CURED framework in guidelines for managing global projects involving multiple stakeholders.
Public Awareness and Educational Programs:

Public Engagement: Conduct public seminars and online courses on the importance of managing relational risks in complex projects. Engage with universities and professional bodies to include relational risk management in their curriculum for project management students.
Integration in Higher Education: Collaborate with educational institutions to integrate the study’s findings into MBA programs and project management courses, ensuring that future project managers are trained in relational risk management from the start of their careers.
Follow-up Research and Expansion:

Continuous Research: Support follow-up studies that explore how the CURED framework can be expanded or refined for other sectors (e.g., IT outsourcing, government contracting). This will keep the research dynamic and evolving.
Knowledge Sharing Platforms: Create a knowledge-sharing hub where project managers and contractors can exchange experiences, case studies, and best practices in relational risk management.
Summary of Key Pathways
Pre-publication: Engage stakeholders early, test the framework in pilot projects, and disseminate findings at conferences to build interest and credibility.
Post-publication: Ensure wide dissemination through academic and industry-specific channels, provide training and capacity-building programs, advocate for policy integration, and integrate the framework into project management tools.
Long-term: Monitor and refine the framework based on feedback, promote global adoption, and support ongoing research and education to sustain the impact over time.
By following these detailed research impact pathways, the study can achieve its full potential in transforming how client-contractor relationships are managed, leading to improved project outcomes across various sectors.
