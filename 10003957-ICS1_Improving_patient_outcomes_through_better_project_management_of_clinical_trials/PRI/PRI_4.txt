Based on the detailed research impact dimensions provided in the accompanying documents and my understanding of the uploaded study on resolving agency issues in client-contractor relationships, here is a detailed breakdown of the potential research impacts of this study:

1. Academic Impact:
Advancement in Project Management Theory: This study makes a significant academic contribution by expanding on agency theory and project management in the context of managing relational risks in client-contractor relationships. It offers a new framework (CURED) to mitigate these risks, which could influence future research in project management, organizational behavior, and contracting.
Example: Academic researchers can build on this study to further explore and refine mechanisms for handling relational risks in multi-stakeholder projects, potentially influencing project management education and training.

2. Industry Impact:
Application in Construction and Clinical Research Industries: By identifying practical strategies for reducing relational risks between clients and contractors, the study has immediate implications for industries such as construction and clinical trials. The CURED framework can be adopted as part of the standard project management practices to enhance cooperation and reduce delays caused by misaligned objectives or poor communication.
Example: Construction firms can implement the CURED framework to avoid project delays and budget overruns, while clinical research organizations can ensure smoother collaboration during multi-phase drug trials.

3. Policy Impact:
Influence on Project Governance Policies: The findings could influence policymakers and industry regulators to integrate relationship management principles into project governance guidelines. This could lead to the adoption of relationship-based contracting as a best practice in sectors where outsourcing is prevalent.
Example: Governmental bodies managing public infrastructure projects may require contractors to adhere to the relational risk management protocols suggested by the CURED framework.

4. Health and Well-being Impact:
Impact on Clinical Trials: The application of this study’s framework in clinical research can enhance the management of complex, multi-stakeholder trials, leading to faster drug approvals and improved public health outcomes. Better collaboration between trial sponsors and contractors will minimize delays and increase the efficiency of drug development.
Example: Patients awaiting critical medications (e.g., haemophilia treatments) will benefit from faster and more efficient clinical trials due to improved relational risk management between trial stakeholders.

5. Economic Impact:
Cost Reduction in Projects: By reducing the relational conflicts that often result in project delays and budget overruns, the implementation of the CURED framework could save millions in project costs across industries. These savings would be passed on to contractors, clients, and the end-users.
Example: In the construction industry, where cost overruns are common, this framework could lead to significant cost reductions in large-scale infrastructure projects.

6. Technological Impact:
Potential Integration into Project Management Software: The CURED framework could be integrated into project management tools such as MS Project or Primavera, allowing real-time monitoring of client-contractor relationships and ensuring early detection of relational risks.
Example: Software vendors could develop specialized features within project management platforms that track and manage the relationship dynamics in outsourced projects.

7. Sustainability Impact:
Long-term Relationship Building: By promoting ethical and sustainable practices in client-contractor relationships, this study encourages long-term partnerships based on trust and mutual understanding, which is key to sustainable project success. Such practices are crucial in industries like construction, where projects span multiple years.
Example: Contractors may focus on long-term relationship-building rather than short-term financial gains, leading to more sustainable project ecosystems.

8. Global Impact:
Transferability to International Projects: The principles of relational risk management outlined in this study are globally applicable, particularly in industries that rely on cross-border contracting. This is crucial for multinational projects that require alignment between different cultural and organizational practices.
Example: International infrastructure projects, such as those funded by the World Bank or OECD, could adopt these principles to manage contractor relationships more effectively across different regulatory environments.

9. Social Impact:
Improvement of Project Success Rates: By improving the relationships between clients and contractors, the study ensures higher project success rates, leading to better infrastructure, healthcare services, and technological developments. The societal benefits from improved project outcomes are significant, particularly in developing countries where effective project management can accelerate economic growth.
Example: Infrastructure projects in underdeveloped regions could be delivered more efficiently, providing essential services like roads, hospitals, and schools to underserved communities.

10. Training and Capacity Building:
Development of Training Programs: The study’s findings can inform training programs for project managers and contract managers, ensuring that they are equipped with the tools to manage complex relational risks. Such training will be critical in industries that rely heavily on outsourcing.
Example: Professional bodies like the PMI (Project Management Institute) could integrate this framework into their certification programs, ensuring future project managers are trained in the best practices of relationship management.
