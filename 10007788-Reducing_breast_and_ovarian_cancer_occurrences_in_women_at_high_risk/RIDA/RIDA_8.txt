To assess the research impact dimensions of the study you provided ("Cost-effectiveness and Benefit-to-Harm Ratio of Risk-Stratified Screening for Breast Cancer"), I will analyze each of the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as outlined. Here is the dimension-by-dimension assessment based on the provided text:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Risk-stratified screening could improve the benefit-to-harm ratio and the cost-effectiveness of the breast screening program" (Results, page 1506).
The research combines healthcare (preventing breast cancer deaths), economics (cost-effectiveness), and public policy (shaping screening recommendations). Page Reference: Results, page 1506. Example: The research influences the health domain by offering a better screening strategy for breast cancer, minimizing overdiagnosis and deaths. It impacts the economic domain by showing cost-effective healthcare interventions and can influence public policy to adapt more personalized screening programs.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The relationship between the cost of the program and the QALYs gained shows diminishing return with offering screening to women at lower risk" (Discussion, page 1508).
"Not offering breast cancer screening to women at lower risk could improve the cost-effectiveness of the screening program" (Conclusions, page 1504). Page Reference: Discussion, page 1508; Conclusions, page 1504. Example: Long-term impact: The research provides foundational knowledge for future studies on personalized healthcare screening strategies. Short-term impact: It can quickly influence how breast cancer screening is approached in healthcare policy decisions.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"A risk-stratified screening strategy could improve the benefit-to-harm ratio and the cost-effectiveness of the breast screening program" (Results, page 1506). Page Reference: Results, page 1506. Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare providers (oncologists and primary care physicians) who implement screening strategies and policy-makers who could adjust national screening guidelines. Indirect stakeholders are the general public, especially women in the age group for screening.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"The study suggests that a more personalized screening strategy could reduce overdiagnosis while preventing breast cancer deaths" (Results, page 1506). Page Reference: Results, page 1506. Example: Deep impact: The research has a transformative influence on breast cancer screening protocols by proposing a shift away from age-based screening. Broad impact: It could influence various healthcare domains, including oncology, policy-making, and public health education.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"This study provides evidence that risk-stratified screening could improve healthcare delivery for breast cancer" (Discussion, page 1508). Page Reference: Discussion, page 1508. Example: Scalability: The model developed could be scaled up to inform national breast cancer screening programs globally. Transferability: This approach could be applied to other diseases where risk stratification could optimize screening, such as prostate cancer.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"A more personalized approach to breast cancer screening based on individual risk could fundamentally change the current screening model" (Discussion, page 1508). Page Reference: Discussion, page 1508. Example: The research introduces an innovative screening method that tailors breast cancer screening based on individual risk factors, potentially disrupting the traditional age-based model in many healthcare systems.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Targeting screening to women at higher risk...reduces overdiagnosis" (Results, page 1506). Page Reference: Results, page 1506. Example: Sustainability: The proposed method reduces unnecessary treatments, promoting a more sustainable healthcare system by conserving resources. Ethical considerations: Reducing overdiagnosis also mitigates the ethical issue of subjecting low-risk women to unnecessary medical interventions.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The program would cost Â£537 985 less, yield 443 more QALYs, have 53 fewer overdiagnoses" (Results, page 1506). Page Reference: Results, page 1506. Example: The study provides practical insights into how healthcare systems can implement a risk-based screening strategy to improve outcomes while reducing costs, making it highly usable in real-world healthcare settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"This study contributes to the global understanding of how personalized medicine can be applied in population-based health programs" (Discussion, page 1508). Page Reference: Discussion, page 1508. Example: The research is globally relevant, as breast cancer is a worldwide health issue. It has cross-disciplinary relevance by combining economics, healthcare, genetics, and policy-making.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The findings suggest that the program could be adjusted based on emerging data on breast cancer risk factors" (Discussion, page 1508). Page Reference: Discussion, page 1508. Example: The risk-stratified screening model is adaptable to changing risk profiles and new evidence, making it resilient to future healthcare challenges.
This analysis gives you a detailed understanding of how this study maps onto the 10 research impact dimensions.
