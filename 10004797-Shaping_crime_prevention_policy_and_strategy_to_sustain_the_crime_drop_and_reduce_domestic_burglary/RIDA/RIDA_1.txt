Based on the instructions and content from both the "Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions" file and the research paper titled "The International Crime Drop: Trends and Variations," here is a detailed assessment of the research impact across the top 10 dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "This paper examines aggregate crime trends and variation around them from 1988 to 2004 for 26 countries and five volume crime types using data from the International Crime Victims Survey." (Abstract, Page 2)
Example: The research impacts the social domain by contributing to the understanding of crime trends, which could influence public policy and societal awareness regarding crime prevention. In the policy domain, findings about the international crime drop may guide government strategies on crime reduction.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The mean international crime drop appeared to be sharper for theft from car, theft from person and assaults than for burglary and car theft which fell in a more prolonged and linear fashion." (Conclusion, Page 21)
Example: The research demonstrates short-term impact by providing data that could influence immediate crime reduction policies. Its findings on long-term trends in crime reduction also position it for a long-term impact in shaping future criminological research and policymaking over decades.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "This study examined cross–national trends in incidence, prevalence and concentration rates of five crime types for 1988 to 2004 for the 26 countries which participated in at least three of the five ICVS sweeps to date." (Conclusion, Page 20)
Example: Direct stakeholders include policymakers and law enforcement agencies who use the research to develop crime prevention strategies. Indirect stakeholders include the general public, who benefit from reduced crime rates and safer communities as a result of the informed policies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The crime rates of individual countries vary from the respective international mean rates. The nature of this variation can change over time." (Results, Page 16)
Example: The research has broad impact across multiple fields such as criminology, public policy, and sociology. Its deep impact is particularly evident in the criminology field, where it provides a robust analysis of crime trends that could reshape crime prevention strategies globally.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The survey is administered using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) in industrialized countries and face-to-face interviews in developing countries." (Data Section, Page 5)
Example: The research findings are scalable, as the trends and analysis could be applied to crime prevention efforts globally, beyond the 26 countries in the dataset. Additionally, its methodological framework for analyzing crime trends is transferable to other regions and contexts, such as developing countries.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The unique contribution of the ICVS is that it asks respondents in different countries the same questions about their crime experiences." (Analysis, Page 8)
Example: The use of the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) to analyze cross-national crime trends introduces innovation in criminological research by providing a standardized way to compare crime trends globally. While not disruptive, it advances current methodologies in crime trend analysis.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "Although several limitations of the ICVS have been identified, it is not believed that they would unduly affect findings of the present study." (Data Section, Page 8)
Example: The study highlights ethical considerations around the limitations of data collection methods, such as response biases. By addressing these limitations, it ensures that the research results are reliable and can sustainably inform policy without being ethically compromised.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The present study builds on, and is viewed by the authors as complementary to, the work of van Dijk et al. (2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007)." (Introduction, Page 3)
Example: The findings are highly usable for policymakers, criminologists, and public safety officials, who can implement them in crime reduction strategies. The research also provides usable data for future academic studies exploring crime trends and prevention.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "The cross–national (in reality predominately North American and North European) trend was estimated using multilevel modelling." (Conclusion, Page 20)
Example: The study has global relevance as it spans 26 countries and uses a standardized methodology. It is also cross-disciplinary, impacting criminology, sociology, and public policy by providing valuable insights into crime trends that can inform various sectors.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The analytic models seek to account for sample variation that is due to the over-representation of cities in some national samples, and any issue induced by the sweeping political changes in former communist countries." (Methodology, Page 10)
Example: The study demonstrates resilience by adapting its analysis to account for varying sample sizes and political changes in different countries, making it robust in addressing diverse contexts. Its methodological adaptability ensures that the findings remain relevant across changing political landscapes.
This detailed analysis maps the research impact of the study across the 10 dimensions, with excerpts and examples showcasing its contributions to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications.
