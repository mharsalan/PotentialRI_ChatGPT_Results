Based on the provided document, the following analysis addresses the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" as they pertain to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes described in the study. These dimensions help evaluate the impact of this research on different societal, environmental, and academic domains:

Domains of Research Impact (RI)

Excerpts: The research on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) crosses several domains including environmental, policy, social, and economic spheres. Specifically, it addresses how EIA frameworks like the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) evaluate sustainability issues, biodiversity, air quality, and socio-economic aspects.
"The SEA framework was developed to ensure the integration of environmental, health, and socio-economic aspects into transportation policies." (Methods, page 15)
Example: This research impacts environmental policy by refining how SEA integrates indicators like air quality and biodiversity, shaping more sustainable transport systems in urban planning.
Duration of RI

Excerpts: The research is foundational for both short-term and long-term impacts, especially in terms of policy development and environmental sustainability.
"Without the implementation of the plan, performance against a number of SEA objectives would decline, affecting air quality and flood risk in the long-term." (Results, page 16)
Example: The long-term impact is seen in its potential to guide future policies that protect environmental assets over decades, influencing global climate mitigation strategies.
Stakeholder of RI

Excerpts: Key stakeholders include government bodies, policymakers, environmental consultants, local communities, and industry professionals involved in infrastructure planning.
"Stakeholders like Natural England and the Environment Agency were consulted in the assessment of the SEA framework." (Discussion, page 14)
Example: Policymakers use the findings to improve regional transport systems while local communities benefit from better air quality and environmental protections.
Depth and Breadth of Impact

Excerpts: This research has both deep and broad impact. Deep in the environmental domain, by advancing specific methodologies for impact assessment, and broad in its cross-sector application.
"The SEA framework covered issues like climate change, flood risk, and biodiversity, providing an extensive breadth of analysis across environmental and social issues." (Methods, page 15)
Example: The research is broad, influencing multiple sectors from environmental policy to urban planning, while deeply affecting the methodologies for impact assessment.
Scalability and Transferability

Excerpts: The SEA framework developed can be applied to various regions and adapted for different types of projects.
"The framework's indicators can be transferred and applied to other regional projects facing similar environmental challenges." (Results, page 18)
Example: The SEA framework is scalable and can be adapted to different geographic regions or industries, particularly for projects like transportation or energy infrastructure.
Innovation and Disruption Potential

Excerpts: The research introduces innovative methods for assessing cumulative environmental impacts and integrating them into planning.
"The SEA framework's use of multiple indicators to assess cumulative impacts represents an innovation in impact assessment methodologies." (Methods, page 17)
Example: The innovation lies in how it integrates multiple dimensions (e.g., air quality, socio-economic impacts) into a single framework, which could disrupt traditional single-focus EIA processes.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations

Excerpts: The research emphasizes the need for sustainability in planning and decision-making.
"SEA objectives covered sustainability indicators, ensuring that biodiversity, air quality, and community well-being were considered in urban transport planning." (Results, page 16)
Example: The research supports long-term environmental sustainability by ensuring that planning frameworks prioritize reducing carbon emissions and conserving natural resources.
Implementation and Usability

Excerpts: The research provides clear recommendations for practical application.
"The SEA framework is designed to be easily implemented by local governments in their transportation planning processes." (Methods, page 16)
Example: Local governments can readily use this research to create more sustainable transportation systems, improving air quality and mitigating climate risks.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance

Excerpts: The research is relevant globally as it tackles universal environmental challenges like air pollution and biodiversity loss.
"The SEA framework incorporates globally recognized indicators like biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation." (Discussion, page 18)
Example: This research is globally relevant and can be adopted in different countries, especially in addressing climate change and sustainability in transport planning.
Resilience and Adaptability

Excerpts: The SEA framework's adaptability ensures that it can handle varying environmental and socio-economic conditions.
"The framework is designed to be resilient, adapting to different regional environmental challenges and policy frameworks." (Methods, page 15)
Example: The adaptable nature of the SEA framework allows it to be applied to new and emerging environmental challenges, making it a resilient tool for future planning needs.
