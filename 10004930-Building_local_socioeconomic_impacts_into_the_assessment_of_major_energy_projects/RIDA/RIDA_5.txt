To assess the research impact dimensions of the study you provided, here is a detailed analysis aligned with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as outlined in your provided framework​​:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study on large energy projects and Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs) addresses multiple domains: environmental, social, economic, and policy impacts. "These are often controversial projects... Energy projects provide particularly high-profile cases"​.
Example: In the environmental domain, CBAs related to energy projects help mitigate the local environmental impacts of infrastructure like nuclear power stations and wind farms. In the social domain, CBAs aim to empower local communities affected by large energy projects by providing financial incentives or infrastructure support.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The use of CBAs, especially in the energy sector, has been evolving over the last 15 years"​.
Example: Short-term impacts include immediate benefits to local communities (e.g., compensation or infrastructure development), while long-term impacts arise from enhanced community empowerment and sustainable development strategies facilitated by ongoing energy projects.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: "CBAs involve agreements between developers and host communities, but also have implications for government bodies and environmental agencies"​.
Example: Direct stakeholders include project developers and local communities who receive benefits. Indirect stakeholders involve policymakers and environmental regulators who use CBAs to balance development goals with public interests.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "CBAs are becoming a growing element in the assessment and development of major projects, especially energy projects, in the UK and internationally"​.
Example: The depth of impact is shown through the transformative effect CBAs have on community engagement in energy projects. The breadth comes from the cross-disciplinary influence of CBAs, affecting fields like urban planning, environmental policy, and social justice.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "CBAs are used in various large energy projects, from wind farms to nuclear waste disposal, and are increasingly adopted internationally"​.
Example: CBAs are highly scalable, as they can be applied to projects of varying sizes—from local wind farms to national-scale nuclear projects. They are also transferable across sectors like waste management, infrastructure development, and energy production globally.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "CBAs offer a new method for addressing the socio-economic impacts of large projects, shifting traditional developer-community relationships"​.
Example: CBAs are innovative in their approach to community compensation, promoting a more collaborative, rather than adversarial, relationship between developers and communities. This model has disruptive potential in changing how large infrastructure projects are approved and executed by incorporating community benefits into the planning process.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "CBAs also include environmental improvement measures and infrastructure development that promote long-term community well-being"​.
Example: CBAs enhance sustainability by ensuring that communities benefit from large energy projects without bearing the full environmental or social costs. The inclusion of ethical considerations, such as fair compensation and community participation, ensures that local populations are not exploited.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The implementation of CBAs varies across projects, but guidelines and toolkits have been developed to support their effective use in energy sectors"​.
Example: CBAs are highly usable because they come with established guidelines, such as those developed for wind energy projects, making it easier for developers and communities to implement them. This ensures practical application across different contexts.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "CBAs in the UK, particularly in energy projects, draw from international practices and have relevance beyond local contexts, influencing global environmental and social policies"​.
Example: CBAs have cross-disciplinary relevance, influencing fields like environmental science, law, social policy, and economics. Globally, they are being adapted for use in different countries, making them relevant to international stakeholders in infrastructure development and environmental management.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "CBAs need to be adaptable to different types of projects and evolving local needs"​.
Example: CBAs enhance the resilience of communities by ensuring that benefits can be adjusted as projects evolve over time. Their adaptability is key to addressing new challenges that arise during the lifecycle of large energy projects, such as changes in community needs or environmental conditions.
This analysis shows how the study aligns with each of the key dimensions of research impact, offering insights into the multi-faceted influence CBAs have on communities, industries, and policymaking both in the UK and globally.
