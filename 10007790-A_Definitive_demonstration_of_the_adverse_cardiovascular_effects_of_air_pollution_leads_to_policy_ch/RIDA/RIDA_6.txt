Here is the breakdown of the research impact dimensions for the attached study:

Domains of Research Impact (RI)

Excerpt: "Several studies have examined associations with subclinical atherosclerosis, the underlying pathology of most coronary events." The research contributes to understanding the mechanisms through which air pollution influences cardiovascular health, particularly subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and thrombogenicity.
Page Reference and Section: Introduction and Background, Page 30 .
Example: This research contributes to the academic domain by advancing knowledge on how air pollution leads to cardiovascular risks, supporting the public health domain with policy implications for reducing exposure.
Duration of Research Impact (RI)

Excerpt: "Efforts to reduce exposure to air pollution should urgently be intensified, supported by appropriate and effective legislation."
Page Reference and Section: Conclusions and Future Research Directions, Page 92 .
Example: The study has both short-term impact by highlighting immediate health risks and potential short-term interventions and long-term impacts as it sets the foundation for continued research and public health policies to mitigate air pollution effects over years.
Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)

Excerpt: "Health professionals, including cardiologists, have an important role to play in supporting educational and policy initiatives."
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion, Page 92 .
Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare providers and policymakers who will utilize the findings to influence treatment plans and environmental health policies. Indirectly, the general public and future generations stand to benefit from reduced cardiovascular risks due to improved air quality.
Depth and Breadth of Impact

Excerpt: "Air pollution should be viewed as one of several major modifiable risk factors in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease."
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion, Page 92 .
Example: The study has a deep impact within cardiovascular research by identifying air pollution as a critical modifiable risk factor. It also demonstrates broad impact by influencing environmental health policies, medical practices, and public awareness about pollution and heart health.
Scalability and Transferability

Excerpt: "Reducing exposure to ambient PM in Beijing, China... lowered ambulatory blood pressure and reduced exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia."
Page Reference and Section: Mechanisms of Heart Failure, Page 91 .
Example: The research's findings on reducing air pollution effects in a major city like Beijing can be scaled globally to improve cardiovascular health in other urban environments with high pollution levels. The methods and findings are transferable across geographic contexts.
Innovation and Disruption Potential

Excerpt: "The study links cardiovascular disease progression to air pollution using epigenetic and vascular dysfunction pathways."
Page Reference and Section: Mechanisms, Page 91 .
Example: The study introduces innovative research into how air pollution affects cardiovascular health at a molecular and epigenetic level. It disrupts traditional perspectives by highlighting new pathways through which pollution influences heart disease progression, changing the focus of both research and treatment approaches.

Sustainability and Ethical Considerations

Excerpt: "Efforts to reduce air pollution should urgently be intensified, as it will not only prevent disease but contribute to overall sustainable development by improving air quality globally."
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion, Page 91.
Example: The study promotes environmental sustainability by emphasizing the importance of reducing air pollution, which has both health benefits and environmental impacts. Ethically, the research calls for stronger regulations to protect vulnerable populations from air pollution, aligning with public health ethics.
Implementation and Usability

Excerpt: "The findings have strong public health implications, as reducing exposure to air pollution could immediately benefit cardiovascular health on a population level."
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Page 89.
Example: The study’s findings are highly implementable in public health policies, particularly in urban settings where air pollution is a major concern. Governments can use the research to inform air quality standards, with immediate usability in reducing cardiovascular disease.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance

Excerpt: "Air pollution, a global environmental issue, not only affects cardiovascular health but also intersects with public policy, economics, and urban planning."
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, Page 30.
Example: The research has global relevance as it addresses air pollution, which is a worldwide concern, affecting diverse regions. It integrates insights from medicine, environmental science, and public policy, making it cross-disciplinary and applicable in global health and environmental frameworks.
Resilience and Adaptability

Excerpt: "If these data were confirmed in humans, it would dramatically change our perception of long-term risks and influence healthcare policymaking for decades."
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion, Page 92.
Example: The research is resilient as it continues to be relevant with new discoveries about air pollution’s long-term health effects. It also demonstrates adaptability, as future data on epigenetic effects could lead to revised public health policies, showing the study’s capacity to evolve with emerging scientific evidence.
These dimensions align with the study’s focus on air pollution’s impact on cardiovascular health, its policy implications, and global relevance.
