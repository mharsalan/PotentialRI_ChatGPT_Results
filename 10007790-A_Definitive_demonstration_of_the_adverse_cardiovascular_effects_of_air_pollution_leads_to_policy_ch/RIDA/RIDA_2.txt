Based on your uploaded study on air pollution and stroke, here is the detailed research impact assessment mapped to the top 10 dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"Gaseous and particulate air pollutants have a marked and close temporal association with admissions to hospital for stroke or mortality from stroke." (Conclusion, page 5) . Domains:
Health: Significant implications for cardiovascular disease management and stroke prevention strategies.
Environmental: Policies aimed at reducing air pollution could have direct public health benefits.
Policy: Potential to influence both environmental and public health policy. Example: Research findings can guide policymakers in designing air quality regulations aimed at reducing stroke incidence rates, especially in high-risk urban areas.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Over the past three decades, epidemiological studies...have shown strong associations between air pollution and stroke." (Results, page 5) .
"Public and environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could reduce the burden of stroke." (Conclusion, page 5) . Categories:
Short-term Impact: Immediate recognition of air pollution as a stroke risk factor may lead to policy changes.
Long-term Impact: Over time, policies reducing air pollution can decrease the global stroke burden. Example: New regulations addressing emissions could have lasting public health impacts by decreasing stroke-related mortality globally.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"These associations were strongest in low and middle income countries, suggesting the need for policy changes to reduce personal exposure to air pollutants..." (Discussion, page 6) . Stakeholders:
Healthcare providers: Insights into preventing stroke can improve clinical guidelines.
Policymakers: New data can inform public health and environmental legislation.
The Public: Ultimately benefits from reduced air pollution and lower stroke incidence rates. Example: Healthcare practitioners may update prevention guidelines, while governments can enact stricter air quality regulations to protect citizens, especially in high-pollution urban areas.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Gaseous and particulate air pollutants have a robust and close temporal association with admission to hospital for stroke or stroke death." (Discussion, page 5) . Depth:
Provides critical insights into the specific link between air pollution and cerebrovascular events. Breadth:
Impacts multiple disciplines including epidemiology, environmental science, and public health. Example: The research crosses boundaries, contributing to advancements in public health policy and environmental sciences, broadening the focus from cardiac to cerebrovascular effects of pollution.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Public and environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could reduce the burden of stroke." (Conclusion, page 5) . Scalability:
Can be scaled globally, especially in high-pollution areas where stroke rates are increasing. Transferability:
Results are transferable to global health initiatives, particularly in developing countries experiencing increased stroke rates due to poor air quality. Example: This research can be used by WHO to scale public health interventions and apply air quality policies in various countries.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"This is the first comprehensive prespecified pooled analysis to examine the short term effects after exposure to gaseous or particulate air pollution..." (Methods, page 4) . Innovation:
Introduces a comprehensive pooled analysis combining multiple pollutants and stroke types. Disruption:
Shifts focus from cardiac-related morbidity due to air pollution to cerebrovascular events, potentially disrupting current preventive strategies. Example: This could lead to a paradigm shift in how air pollution-related health risks are managed, expanding focus beyond heart disease to include stroke.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The associations were strongest in low and middle income countries...suggesting the need for policy changes..." (Discussion, page 5) . Sustainability:
Highlighting the need for sustainable air quality improvements that benefit long-term public health. Ethical Considerations:
Ensuring equitable access to clean air in both high-income and low/middle-income regions is a critical ethical consideration. Example: Efforts to reduce air pollution can also improve global equity by providing underserved populations with cleaner air and reduced health disparities.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Public and environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could reduce the burden of stroke." (Conclusion, page 5) . Implementation:
The findings provide actionable insights for environmental and public health policymakers. Usability:
Policies can be implemented at multiple governmental levels, influencing urban planning and industrial regulations. Example: Air quality standards could be adapted in both developing and developed regions to mitigate stroke risks.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Gaseous and particulate air pollutants...strong temporal association with admission to hospital for stroke." (Results, page 5) . Cross-disciplinary:
Bridges environmental science, healthcare, epidemiology, and public policy. Global Relevance:
Applicable globally, especially in high-density urban areas and developing nations with poor air quality. Example: Findings can guide global public health organizations and climate scientists in mitigating the intersection of air pollution and stroke risk.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Particulate air pollution alone is responsible for over three million deaths each year." (Introduction, page 1) . Resilience:
Long-lasting relevance as air pollution remains a persistent global issue. Adaptability:
Findings can evolve with changes in pollution patterns and advancements in stroke prevention. Example: The adaptable nature of the research allows it to stay relevant as new pollutants or emerging diseases challenge current healthcare systems.
These dimensions highlight the broad and lasting impact of the study, spanning healthcare, environmental policy, and global health initiatives.
