Based on the content in the provided document on Research Impact Dimensions, the study can be mapped to the following dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: The study contributes to advancing the academic understanding of queer vocal timbres in musicology, performance studies, and gender studies. By exploring how queerness is expressed and interpreted through vocal timbre, the study adds a unique theoretical dimension to these fields.
Cultural Domain: It significantly impacts the cultural and artistic domain by exploring queer auditory sensations and vocal performance. It challenges normative frameworks within vocal performance and brings attention to queer identities in cultural expressions​(1 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: The study can influence academic discourse around queer sound studies, generating immediate citations and discussions in conferences and journals within performance and queer studies.
Long-term Impact: Over time, this research could lay the groundwork for further interdisciplinary studies combining musicology, queer studies, and sensory perception, becoming a foundational text for future research in queer sound and performance theory​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Academics in musicology, gender studies, and performance studies who can incorporate its insights into their research and teaching. Additionally, performers and vocalists who identify with queer identities might find it directly relevant to their practice.
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader LGBTQ+ communities may benefit indirectly as the research contributes to societal discussions around queer expression, potentially influencing artistic performances and cultural representations​(1 (2)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: This study has a profound impact on queer sound studies, offering a deep analysis that could redefine how vocal performances are understood in relation to identity and gender. It presents a new conceptual framework for understanding vocal timbre in queer contexts.
Broad Impact: The research could influence fields beyond musicology, extending to cultural studies, performance art, and gender theory. It could also shape discussions in LGBTQ+ studies on how vocal expression ties to identity​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The conceptual framework developed in this research can be scaled across various types of vocal performance beyond the queer context, including broader studies on vocal timbre and identity expression.
Transferability: Its ideas can be transferred to fields such as film studies, theatre arts, and sociolinguistics, where voice and identity are crucial topics​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces innovative ways to explore vocal timbre as a form of queer expression. This is a novel intersection of queer theory and auditory experience, offering fresh perspectives in performance research.
Disruption: It disrupts traditional academic approaches to vocal performance by challenging normative assumptions and placing queerness at the forefront of vocal timbre analysis​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (2)).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: By promoting the inclusion of queer voices in performance studies, the research fosters a sustainable academic discourse that includes diverse identities.
Ethical Considerations: The study highlights the ethical importance of representation in vocal performances and ensures that marginalized voices are considered in academic and cultural discussions​(1 (2)).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study’s theoretical framework could be implemented in academic courses on musicology, queer studies, and performing arts, providing students and researchers with new ways to engage with voice and identity.
Usability: Performers could use the insights from this research to develop queer vocal techniques, influencing how vocal training incorporates identity and gender expression​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research bridges several disciplines, including music, gender studies, performance studies, and queer theory. It also has potential applications in media studies and sociolinguistics, expanding its influence across the humanities.
Global Relevance: Given the global nature of queer identity and the growing visibility of LGBTQ+ issues, the study has the potential to influence global discourse on vocal performance and identity, making it relevant in diverse cultural contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study’s framework is adaptable to changes in cultural discourse around gender and sexuality, ensuring its long-term relevance.
Adaptability: The concepts can be applied to future research exploring vocal performance in different cultural or historical settings, adapting to various forms of queer expression in art and performance​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This detailed mapping highlights how the study engages with key dimensions of research impact, from academic innovation to broader cultural and social influences.
