It provides educators with new tools to incorporate practical performance into academic research, influencing curricula at universities and performing arts schools​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Capacity Building in Arts Education: By establishing performance as a form of research-driven knowledge production, the study enhances the capacity of arts educators and students to engage with performance in a more analytical and reflective manner, promoting long-term educational impacts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Contribution to Policy on Arts Funding: The study can influence policy discussions on arts funding, advocating for the recognition of performance as research in funding applications. By showing that performance generates knowledge and societal impact, it may lead to changes in how research grants and cultural programs are designed to support performance-based projects​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Technological and Methodological Impact
Innovation in Research Methods: The study contributes innovative methods for conducting research through performance, offering alternative ways to engage with qualitative research and knowledge generation. This methodological impact can be transferred to other fields that explore practice-based research, such as visual arts and digital media​(Common Research Impact …).
Adoption of Digital Tools for Performance Research: The incorporation of digital storytelling, video recording, and other technologies in documenting and analyzing performance can inspire new technological tools for enhancing performance-based research, particularly in documenting artistic processes​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Social Justice and Equity
Amplifying Marginalized Voices in Performance: The study advocates for the recognition of performance as research, particularly in underrepresented communities. It highlights the role of performance in expressing marginalized voices and encourages the use of performance as a platform for social justice. This can promote more inclusive practices in both academia and the arts​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Long-term Societal Impact
Sustaining Performance as a Research Methodology: In the long term, the study’s validation of performance as research can sustain its use as a legitimate research method. This will influence future generations of performers, artists, and researchers who see performance not only as artistic expression but also as a form of intellectual inquiry​(Research impact toolkit).
Cultural Sustainability: By promoting performance as a tool for cultural understanding, the study supports the preservation of cultural heritage through performance. It encourages the integration of traditional practices with academic research, fostering long-term impacts on cultural preservation​(impact pathway).
8. Economic Impact
Impact on Cultural Economies: The study could impact the cultural economy by increasing the visibility and legitimacy of performance-based projects in research funding cycles. As more funding becomes available for performance as research, it could lead to economic growth within the creative industries, supporting artists, theatres, and cultural institutions​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary Impact
Influence on Interdisciplinary Research: This study will likely have cross-disciplinary impacts, especially in fields such as anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies. By demonstrating how performance can be used to generate knowledge in these fields, it encourages collaboration between the arts and social sciences​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Implementation and Usability
Implementation in Artistic Practices: The study offers tools that can be implemented directly by performers, theatre companies, and researchers. It encourages practical application in the form of workshops, performances, and creative projects, making its findings immediately useful for those in the field​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Usability in Research Design: Researchers in the arts can use the study’s findings to design new projects that integrate performance with research, influencing how artistic research projects are structured and funded in the future​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These dimensions of impact highlight the study’s comprehensive influence across academic, cultural, societal, and policy sectors. Its contributions to performance as research will shape future research methodologies, educational practices, and cultural policies, ensuring a lasting and widespread impact.
