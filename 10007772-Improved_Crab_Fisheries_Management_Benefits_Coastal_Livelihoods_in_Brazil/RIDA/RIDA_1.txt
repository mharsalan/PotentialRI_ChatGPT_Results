Based on the paper you provided and the research impact dimensions framework, here is a breakdown of the research according to the top 10 dimensions of research impact:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The study focuses on the commercial relationship between intermediaries and crab harvesters in the Mamanguape River estuary, detailing the socio-economic impact on local communities, and potential environmental implications due to overexploitation of the mangrove crab U. cordatus​(1) .
Example: The research contributes to understanding the environmental sustainability of crab harvesting practices, impacts on local economies, and can inform policy decisions on fishery management and conservation efforts.
Duration of RI:

Excerpts: The research describes the potential long-term effects of intermediaries influencing crab harvesters, which could lead to environmental degradation and socio-economic dependency. The suggestion for creating cooperatives indicates both short-term improvements and long-term sustainability .
Example: In the short term, this research could inform immediate changes to the crab processing industry, while long-term, it could shape sustainable fishery policies and local economies.
Stakeholder of RI:

Excerpts: Stakeholders include crab harvesters, intermediaries, local communities, environmental organizations, and policy makers​(1) .
Example: Local crab harvesters directly benefit from potential cooperative organizations, while environmental agencies can use the data to inform sustainable practices.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: The research offers deep insights into the socio-economic dynamics of the crab market in Northeast Brazil, and its dependence on intermediaries. Broadly, it highlights how unsustainable practices can affect both local economies and environmental conservation​(1) .
Example: The study has deep impact in fisheries management and socio-economic studies of indigenous communities, while its breadth includes wider implications for environmental policy and sustainability in coastal regions.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: The research suggests creating cooperatives as a scalable solution to improve crab harvesters' economic situations. Transferability can be seen in applying these cooperative models to other small-scale fisheries globally .
Example: Cooperative structures suggested in this research can be adapted to other rural fisheries, improving economic stability and sustainable practices elsewhere.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: The proposal to organize crab harvesters into cooperatives introduces an innovative shift from individual dependency on intermediaries to a more collective, sustainable economic model .
Example: This disruption could shift power dynamics in rural economies, reduce dependency on intermediaries, and promote sustainability through local empowerment.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts: The study addresses sustainability concerns by highlighting the overexploitation of mangrove crabs and the lack of infrastructure to support sustainable practices .
Example: The research could influence ethical practices by encouraging environmentally sustainable harvesting and providing crab harvesters with more equitable economic opportunities through cooperatives.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts: The research suggests practical implementation of cooperatives and infrastructure improvements for crab processing, providing immediate solutions that can be applied in the community .
Example: The suggested cooperative model has high usability, as it offers tangible steps for improving local economies and environmental conservation, which can be adopted by similar coastal communities.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts: The study is interdisciplinary, touching on socio-economic, environmental, and policy dimensions. Its relevance extends to global coastal management issues, particularly in sustainable fisheries​(1) .
Example: The research offers insights that can be applied to global discussions on small-scale fisheries management and the socio-economic impacts of coastal resource exploitation.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts: The proposal for crab harvesters to form cooperatives shows adaptability to changing market conditions and environmental challenges, promoting long-term resilience .
Example: This model enhances community resilience by reducing dependency on intermediaries and promoting sustainable economic practices that can endure environmental and market fluctuations.
