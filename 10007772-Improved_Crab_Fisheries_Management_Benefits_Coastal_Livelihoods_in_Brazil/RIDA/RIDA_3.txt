1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research primarily impacts multiple domains:

Environmental: The study focuses on the andada and its relationship to geophysical cycles, offering insights into improved fisheries management​(3).
Policy: The recommendations for updating crab capture bans during andada phases suggest potential policy changes​(3).
Example: The research can influence environmental policies for sustainable crab fisheries, impacting both environmental conservation and resource management domains.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research demonstrates both short-term and long-term impact potential:

Short-term Impact: Immediate recommendations for extending capture bans during the night and high tide phases​(3).
Long-term Impact: Further testing across the species' range to generalize results, indicating a prolonged influence on management practices​(3).
Example: The short-term impact will be felt by fisheries implementing new regulations, while long-term studies will influence national policy and global fisheries management.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Stakeholders benefiting from the study include:

Fishermen: Adjustments to crab harvesting practices directly affect their livelihoods​(3).
Policymakers: The study provides evidence to create better policies for sustainable fisheries​(3).
Example: Fishermen will see immediate changes in regulations, while policymakers will have data-driven recommendations for managing crab populations, potentially minimizing conflict between communities and regulations.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

Deep Impact: It deeply impacts fisheries management by refining the understanding of andada's timing​(3).
Broad Impact: The study's findings could influence other mating-driven fisheries globally​(3).
Example: The study fundamentally changes crab fisheries management in Brazil while also potentially influencing global fisheries management for other species driven by similar tidal cycles.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research findings are both scalable and transferable:

Scalability: The recommendations can be scaled to cover larger regions in Brazil​(3).
Transferability: The insights into geophysical cycles influencing species behavior could be applied to other species worldwide​(3).
Example: The scalability allows the management strategies to expand to a national level in Brazil, while transferability applies the study's methodology to similar species globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces an innovative approach by linking syzygy tide cycles to crab mating behavior, offering a disruptive shift in traditional crab fishery management:

Innovation: The use of tide tables to predict crab behavior is innovative for fisheries management​(3).
Disruption: Shifting crab bans based on the moon phase disrupts the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to species protection​(3).
Example: This disruption could redefine how fisheries around the world manage species with lunar or tidal mating cycles, encouraging more efficient and biologically sound practices.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study promotes sustainable fisheries management:

Sustainability: By aligning crab capture bans with biological rhythms, the research supports sustainable harvesting practices​(3).
Example: This study ensures long-term sustainability of crab populations while also addressing the economic needs of local fishing communities.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study provides direct, actionable recommendations for fisheries managers to extend bans into night hours and high tide periods​(3).

Example: The practical nature of the study’s findings means that fisheries can immediately implement new management practices with minimal additional costs.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The findings bridge disciplines:

Environmental Science and Policy: Combines biological behavior studies with fisheries management​(3).
Global Relevance: The study's method can be applied to manage other species globally, especially those affected by lunar cycles​(3).
Example: The cross-disciplinary relevance of this study supports global fisheries management and environmental conservation efforts.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research adapts to changing knowledge on geophysical cycles and is resilient in its recommendation for testing and verifying findings across a broader range​(3).
