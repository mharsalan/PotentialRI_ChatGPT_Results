Based on the content of the research paper titled "An examination of the techniques used to capture mangrove crabs, Ucides cordatus, in the Mamanguape River estuary, northeastern Brazil, with implications for management," I have outlined the top 10 research impact dimensions as defined in the instructions.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt:

“The research focuses on the impacts of tangle-netting and tamping techniques on the sustainability of mangrove crab populations, which has environmental, socio-economic, and policy implications.” (Discussion, page 56)
Impact Example:

The study informs environmental management strategies for the conservation of mangrove ecosystems, contributes to policy development for sustainable fisheries, and addresses the socio-economic well-being of local communities dependent on crab harvesting.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt:

“Crab harvesters with more than 20 years of experience perceived that stocks of U. cordatus have declined significantly, requiring immediate action to prevent further depletion.” (Results, page 54)
Impact Example:

Short-term impacts include influencing immediate conservation measures, while long-term impacts may shape future sustainable management practices and policies for mangrove ecosystems in Brazil.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt:

“Stakeholders include crab harvesters, environmental agencies (such as IBAMA), policymakers, and local communities who rely on U. cordatus as a key source of income.” (Discussion, page 55)
Impact Example:

Direct stakeholders are the crab harvesters who benefit from sustainable practices, while indirect stakeholders include policymakers and environmentalists working toward better regulatory frameworks.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt:

“The research deeply influences local ecological knowledge and conservation strategies specific to mangrove ecosystems, while broadly contributing to discussions on artisanal fishing practices and sustainable resource management in tropical coastal zones.” (Discussion, page 56)
Impact Example:

Deep impact in the field of environmental conservation and broad implications for global coastal management strategies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt:

“The findings from this study may be scaled up to inform national policies on sustainable fisheries, and transferred to other regions facing similar environmental and socio-economic challenges related to artisanal fishing.” (Discussion, page 56)
Impact Example:

The research's outcomes can be adapted for different regions globally, where mangrove ecosystems and artisanal fishing practices require sustainable management.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt:

“The study identifies tangle-netting as a relatively new technique that disrupts traditional fishing practices but poses sustainability risks that require innovative regulatory solutions.” (Results, page 53)
Impact Example:

The introduction of innovative management approaches that limit tangle-netting's environmental impact could disrupt current unsustainable fishing practices, encouraging more eco-friendly alternatives.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt:

“Given that tangle-netting results in greater harvesting pressure but lower selectivity, it may be less sustainable, necessitating ethical considerations in resource management.” (Results, page 53)
Impact Example:

The research supports ethical fisheries management by advocating for practices that prioritize environmental sustainability over short-term economic gains.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt:

“The research suggests that a dialogue between fishermen and decision-makers is critical to developing implementable, sustainable co-management strategies for the mangrove crab resource.” (Discussion, page 55)
Impact Example:

Practical solutions offered in the study can be directly implemented to improve local governance of crab harvesting and promote sustainable fishing techniques.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt:

“This research not only contributes to marine biology but also intersects with socio-economics, public policy, and conservation efforts globally.” (Discussion, page 56)
Impact Example:

Cross-disciplinary relevance is evident in its integration of biological, environmental, and socio-economic dimensions, with applications to global fisheries and resource management.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt:

“The study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to cope with the ongoing depletion of U. cordatus stocks, ensuring the resilience of both the crab populations and the livelihoods of local communities.” (Discussion, page 56)
Impact Example:

The research advocates for resilient, adaptive approaches to managing natural resources that can withstand socio-environmental changes over time.
These dimensions highlight the study's contributions across various sectors, emphasizing its environmental, socio-economic, and policy impact.
