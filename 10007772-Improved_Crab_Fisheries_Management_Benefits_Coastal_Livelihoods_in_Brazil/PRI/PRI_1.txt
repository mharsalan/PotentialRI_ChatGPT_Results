Based on the study you provided, several potential research impacts can be identified across different categories, specifically aligned with the detailed dimensions of research impact. Here’s an organized breakdown of potential research impacts, categorized by type:

1. Environmental and Sustainability Impact:
Overexploitation of Mangrove Crabs: The study emphasizes the environmental implications of over-harvesting mangrove crabs (U. cordatus). Research findings on the negative impact of crab exploitation can support sustainable fishery management and conservation efforts in mangrove ecosystems​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
Promotion of Sustainable Practices: By highlighting the role of intermediaries and their influence on unsustainable harvesting, this study can contribute to the development of sustainable harvesting techniques or policies, encouraging more responsible fishing practices​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Economic Impact:
Improving Economic Conditions for Harvesters: The study proposes organizing crab harvesters into cooperatives, potentially leading to increased bargaining power and higher income stability for the local communities. This could stimulate local economies and provide economic resilience in fishing-dependent areas​(Common Research Impact …).
Scalability of Cooperative Models: The cooperative model suggested in the study is transferable and scalable. It can be applied in similar contexts globally, improving the economic stability of small-scale fisheries in other regions​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Social and Cultural Impact:
Empowering Local Communities: The formation of cooperatives can also empower local communities by reducing dependence on intermediaries, promoting self-sufficiency, and fostering social cohesion. This change can improve the social structure of fishing communities, particularly in low-income coastal areas​(1)​(Research impact toolkit).
Cultural Preservation: The study indirectly contributes to preserving the cultural practices of artisanal fishing communities by promoting sustainable methods that align with traditional knowledge while protecting the environment​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Influence and Advocacy:
Informing Fisheries Policy: Research findings on the economic and environmental consequences of crab overexploitation could inform local and national policy on fisheries management. Policymakers could use the study to create more effective regulations that balance economic interests with environmental conservation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Advocacy for Environmental Protection: The study could also be used to advocate for stronger environmental protections and the development of legal frameworks to regulate overharvesting and promote sustainable fishery practices​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Health and Well-being Impact:
Improved Well-being for Fisherfolk: By advocating for cooperatives, the study addresses economic insecurity among harvesters. This could lead to improved livelihoods, reduced poverty, and better health outcomes for these communities, which are often vulnerable to economic fluctuations​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Technological Advancement and Innovation:
Development of New Infrastructure: The study mentions the need for investment in crab-processing infrastructure. Such developments could lead to technological innovations in the fishing industry, making processing more efficient, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable production methods​(1)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Educational Impact:
Knowledge Transfer to Fisherfolk: Educating crab harvesters on sustainable harvesting techniques and the benefits of forming cooperatives can increase awareness and lead to the adoption of more sustainable practices, improving both environmental and economic outcomes​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
8. Implementation and Usability:
Practical Applications for Fisheries: The study’s findings on forming cooperatives and sustainable harvesting practices provide immediate, practical solutions that can be implemented in the community. These solutions have strong usability in other small-scale fisheries facing similar challenges​(1)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Global Relevance for Small-Scale Fisheries: Although the study is focused on a specific region in Brazil, the challenges faced by the crab harvesters are common in many coastal regions globally. The solutions proposed in the study can be applied to small-scale fisheries worldwide, particularly in regions that rely on artisanal fishing for economic survival​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Equity and Inclusivity:
Improving Economic Equity: By addressing the economic exploitation of crab harvesters, the study promotes inclusivity and equity within the local economy. This empowers a marginalized group by providing them with fairer economic opportunities through cooperative structures​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Knowledge Dissemination and Public Awareness:
Raising Awareness on Sustainability Issues: The study has the potential to raise public awareness about the environmental and economic challenges faced by coastal fishing communities. Through dissemination to a broader audience, it could influence public discourse on sustainable fisheries and environmental conservation​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Resilience and Adaptability:
Building Resilience in Coastal Communities: By promoting sustainable economic practices through cooperatives, the study helps build resilience in the local economy and reduces vulnerability to external market pressures. This adaptability is crucial for the long-term survival of small-scale fisheries​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These research impacts reflect the broad and deep implications of the study, not only within its immediate context but also across various domains like sustainability, policy influence, and economic development.
