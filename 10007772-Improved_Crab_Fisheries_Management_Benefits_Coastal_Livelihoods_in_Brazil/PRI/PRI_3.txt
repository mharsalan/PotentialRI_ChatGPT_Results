Based on the study you've shared, I have organized the potential research impacts under relevant categories. These align with predefined research impact dimensions and frameworks:

1. Environmental Impact
Sustainability of Crab Fisheries: The study directly contributes to more sustainable practices in fisheries management, particularly for U. cordatus (crab species). By linking crab reproductive cycles with geophysical phases, the research enables better timing of harvest bans, reducing overfishing and promoting long-term conservation of crab populations​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Preservation: Improved management of crab populations, as informed by the study, contributes to maintaining ecosystem balance, especially in coastal and mangrove regions where crabs play a key ecological role​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Policy Impact
Regulatory Changes in Fisheries Management: The research recommends revising crab fishing regulations to align with biological rhythms such as the andada period (reproductive phase), suggesting extended bans during critical mating phases. This can lead to policy shifts at local and national levels​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Informed Decision-Making for Sustainable Practices: Policymakers can use this data to make informed decisions about the timing of fishing bans, which may influence both local communities and national fisheries policies​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Societal and Economic Impact
Sustaining Fishermen’s Livelihoods: The implementation of better-timed fishing bans not only preserves crab populations but also ensures that local fishermen will continue to benefit from a stable source of income in the long term. Avoiding overharvesting increases the resource's economic viability​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Economic Efficiency in Fisheries: By optimizing the timing for sustainable harvest, the research could indirectly reduce management costs and increase the long-term profitability of the fisheries sector​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Academic and Knowledge Impact
Advancement in Fisheries Management Research: The study provides new insights into how geophysical factors like tides and moon phases affect crab reproduction, potentially influencing future research in marine biology and fisheries science​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Contribution to Multidisciplinary Research: This research crosses boundaries between ecology, marine science, and policy studies, showing how biological findings can directly influence socioeconomic and political decisions​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Improved Public Health through Better Fisheries Management: Healthier crab populations, when sustainably managed, could ensure a reliable source of seafood for communities that depend on it for nutrition, thus contributing to food security and public health in these regions​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovative Use of Geophysical Data: The research introduces an innovative method of using tide and moon phase data to predict reproductive cycles in crabs, an approach that could be disruptive for fisheries management globally by shifting away from traditional, less precise methods of regulating crab harvests​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Technological Application in Fisheries: Potential use of data modeling and predictive analytics based on geophysical cycles could lead to technological innovations in fisheries management tools and applications​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
7. Implementation and Usability
Immediate Application for Crab Fishing Regulations: The study’s findings provide actionable recommendations for fisheries managers to adjust existing crab capture bans, allowing for direct and immediate implementation​(Research impact toolkit).
Scalability: The study’s methodologies, particularly in linking crab reproduction with environmental cycles, could be scaled to broader geographic areas and to other species affected by similar cycles, allowing for wider application in global fisheries management​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Resilience and Adaptability
Adapting to New Ecological Data: The research emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and adjustments in crab harvesting practices as more data becomes available, making it adaptable to future environmental changes​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Cultural and Social Impact
Community Engagement and Awareness: By influencing local fisheries management, the study could foster greater community involvement in sustainable practices, particularly in regions where fishing is a vital cultural and economic activity​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Preserving Traditional Livelihoods: The research helps safeguard traditional fishing practices, enabling local communities to continue their reliance on the resource in a sustainable manner​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Relevance to Global Fisheries: Although the research focuses on a specific crab species, its findings can be applied to other fisheries globally, especially those that involve species with reproductive cycles tied to environmental factors like tides and lunar phases​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness of Sustainable Fisheries: The findings from this research can contribute to public outreach efforts, educating both local fishing communities and broader audiences about the importance of aligning fishing practices with ecological cycles​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Behavioral Change
Changing Fishing Practices: The study encourages a shift in fishing behavior by recommending restrictions during biologically significant times, promoting a long-term change in how fishermen interact with the resource​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These potential impacts cover a range of dimensions, from environmental sustainability to social, economic, and academic influences. They showcase the diverse ways in which the study can affect various sectors and stakeholders.
