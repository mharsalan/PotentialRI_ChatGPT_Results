The document outlines Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact and provides insights into how research can exert influence across various fields. Based on the content of the document, here’s a detailed overview of these research impact dimensions that can be applied to any study, including the one you referenced earlier:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Definition: This dimension focuses on the various sectors where the research exerts influence. This could be in the academic, social, economic, environmental, health, educational, technological, legal, or cultural domains.
Example: A study that examines the sustainability of independent filmmaking could impact economic policy, media industries, and cultural preservation. It contributes to discussions on business models, the creative economy, and accessibility in cultural production.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Definition: This measures the timeframe over which research exerts its influence, which could be short-term (immediate impacts) or long-term (enduring contributions).
Example: The research on open content in filmmaking might have a short-term impact by providing immediate strategies for independent filmmakers and long-term impacts by shaping future business models or influencing the open content movement.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Definition: This dimension looks at the individuals, groups, or sectors that directly or indirectly benefit from research. These could include policymakers, filmmakers, producers, educational institutions, or the general public.
Example: Direct stakeholders of the study on open content filmmaking include independent filmmakers, while indirect stakeholders could be audiences who benefit from more accessible film content.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Definition: Depth refers to the research’s transformative influence within a single field, while breadth captures its cross-disciplinary impact.
Example: The depth of the research could be in the media studies field by advancing theories of content creation. The breadth could be seen in its impact across technology, law (intellectual property), and economics (new business models for film distribution).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Definition: This dimension refers to whether the research can be scaled up or applied in broader contexts (scalability), and whether it can be transferred to other fields or industries.
Example: The concepts of open content filmmaking might be scaled to larger production companies, and its business models could be transferred to other creative industries like music or digital art.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Definition: This measures the degree of innovation introduced by the research and its potential to disrupt traditional approaches or industries.
Example: The research’s focus on Creative Commons licensing and the use of digital tools could disrupt traditional filmmaking models by providing new, innovative approaches to content creation and distribution.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Definition: This dimension considers whether the research promotes sustainable practices or addresses ethical concerns.
Example: The study’s promotion of more sustainable content creation models—reducing dependence on commercial systems—and its emphasis on ethical access to content through open licensing frameworks highlight its ethical implications.
8. Implementation and Usability
Definition: This focuses on the practical implementation of the research findings and their usability by stakeholders.
Example: Independent filmmakers and distributors could immediately implement the licensing strategies and audience engagement tools outlined in the research to optimize their content distribution processes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Definition: This dimension looks at the global and interdisciplinary reach of the research.
Example: The study's insights into open content production can be globally relevant, particularly in industries transitioning to digital-first distribution models, and it has relevance in discussions across fields like law, economics, and technology.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Definition: This considers whether the research can adapt to changing conditions or foster resilience in its application.
Example: The flexible models of licensing and production proposed by the study enable filmmakers to adapt to changes in the media landscape, particularly as digital platforms evolve and new distribution channels emerge.
These dimensions provide a framework for assessing how a study, such as the one on open content filmmaking, can impact various domains over time, influencing stakeholders, promoting innovation, and contributing to both academic and societal advancements.
