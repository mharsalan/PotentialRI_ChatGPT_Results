Based on the study provided and aligning with the predefined Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, here is a detailed breakdown of the research impacts for the study you provided, titled "Examining the Understanding and Management of Risk in the Film Industry."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study primarily focuses on the UK independent film sector but also links to the broader international marketplace and audiovisual sectors such as high-end television (HETV). The findings emphasize how risk is understood and managed in the film industry, impacting not just financial outcomes but also broader economic and cultural aspects of film-making (Executive Summary, page 2)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Executive Summary, page 2.
Example: The research impacts multiple domains, including the economic domain, by improving understanding of financial risks in film-making, and the cultural domain, by enabling better financial support for creative projects that contribute to cultural diversity.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study addresses both immediate concerns (e.g., improving current industry practices) and long-term impacts (e.g., recommendations for systematic changes in risk management and data transparency) (Findings and Proposals, page 20)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Findings and Proposals, page 20.
Example: Short-term impact involves immediate industry applications, such as more effective use of financial tools like tax relief and revenue forecasts, while the long-term impact includes broader policy changes that could ensure sustained investment in the UK independent film sector.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary stakeholders include film industry professionals, policy-makers, and industry support agencies. These groups are crucial in implementing better risk management strategies and improving access to finance (Context, page 2)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Context, page 2.
Example: Direct stakeholders are producers and financiers, who benefit from improved risk management tools. Indirect stakeholders include the wider public, who benefit from a more sustainable and diverse film industry.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research identifies a significant knowledge gap in risk management within the film industry, proposing systemic changes to better inform risk-taking practices. This has both deep impacts within the film industry and broad implications for creative industries globally (Key Findings, page 3)​(1)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Key Findings, page 3.
Example: The depth of impact is shown in the film industry, as it changes how producers and financiers approach risk. The breadth of impact extends to related sectors, such as television and other creative industries, influencing risk assessment across the entire audiovisual field.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study suggests that the tools and practices developed can be scaled beyond the UK context and adapted to other creative industries worldwide (Findings and Proposals, page 20)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Findings and Proposals, page 20.
Example: Scalability is seen in the potential for the study's risk management tools to be implemented in other regions or scaled up to influence international markets. Transferability is evidenced by the ability of these tools to be applied to related fields, such as high-end television production.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research introduces innovative technological approaches to risk management, such as the application of blockchain technology and other data-driven tools (Findings and Proposals, page 22)​(1)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Findings and Proposals, page 22.
Example: The study has disruptive potential by recommending cutting-edge solutions like blockchain, which could revolutionize how contracts and intellectual property are managed in the film industry.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study promotes sustainability in the film industry by addressing systemic under-capitalization and providing solutions to foster long-term business viability (Findings and Proposals, page 22)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Findings and Proposals, page 22.
Example: The research supports economic sustainability by ensuring that film companies are better equipped to manage financial risks, leading to more stable production cycles and ethical business practices in terms of fair access to finance.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study’s recommendations are highly implementable, as they suggest clear steps for improving financial practices, such as the creation of an industry-wide resource for data collection and dissemination (Findings and Proposals, page 22)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Findings and Proposals, page 22.
Example: The proposed data transparency measures are usable by industry professionals and government agencies alike, ensuring that risk management practices can be quickly adopted across the sector.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While focused on the film industry, the study’s findings have cross-disciplinary relevance, particularly for other creative industries, such as music and television, which share similar challenges around risk and financing (Context, page 2)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Context, page 2.
Example: The study’s global relevance is seen in its potential to inform creative industries in other countries, where similar economic conditions and risks exist. Its findings could influence international media markets, especially in Europe and the US.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study calls for adaptable financial structures that can respond to changes in market conditions, such as the digital transformation and Brexit uncertainties (Study Parameters, page 5)​(1).
Page Reference and Section: Study Parameters, page 5.
Example: By encouraging more resilient business models and flexible financial practices, the study ensures that film companies can adapt to economic shocks and industry changes, such as digital disruption.
These dimensions provide a comprehensive view of the potential research impacts of the study, showing how it can shape the film industry in terms of policy, economics, and technology while promoting sustainability and global applicability.
