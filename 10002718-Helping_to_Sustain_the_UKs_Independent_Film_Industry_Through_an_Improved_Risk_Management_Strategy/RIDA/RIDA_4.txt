The attached study, "Revolution remixed? The emergence of Open Content Film-making as a viable component within the mainstream film industry," outlines several key Research Impact Dimensions that align with established frameworks. Based on the document and applying the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions, here is a detailed analysis:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Social Domain: The study has a significant social impact by promoting a more democratized approach to filmmaking through open content. This encourages broader participation in the film industry and enhances access to creative resources for independent filmmakers. The concept of crowdsourced contributions in film production can lead to increased cultural diversity and societal engagement in media production​(4).
Economic Domain: The open content approach, though initially seen as financially unviable, is slowly being adopted within the mainstream, with potential economic benefits. By reducing the barriers to entry for filmmakers and encouraging alternative revenue models such as crowdfunding, it challenges the traditional profit-driven models of the film industry​(4).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study provides immediate insights into the adoption of open content practices in independent filmmaking, which is already influencing how filmmakers engage with distribution and production. The use of Creative Commons licenses offers filmmakers a way to distribute their content more widely, potentially leading to short-term boosts in visibility and audience engagement​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: Over the long term, the research may influence broader discussions on intellectual property reform and the sustainability of open content models, leading to shifts in how cultural industries handle licensing, rights management, and audience engagement​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Independent filmmakers, cultural institutions, and open content advocates are directly affected, as they are the primary users of Creative Commons licenses and open distribution strategies. These stakeholders benefit from more accessible tools and a wider reach for their films​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: The general public benefits indirectly from the increased availability of open content films, which contribute to cultural diversity and public engagement with creative works. Policymakers and educators are also indirect stakeholders, as the study informs discussions on media literacy, cultural access, and copyright policies​(4).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study contributes deeply to the field of media studies and intellectual property law by critically examining how Creative Commons licenses and open content practices interact with the traditional film industry. It challenges the assumptions around profitability and ownership in creative industries​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Broad Impact: Its findings extend beyond the film industry, influencing digital culture, intellectual property frameworks, and crowdsourcing models. The lessons learned from open content filmmaking can be applied in other creative fields, such as music, digital art, and software development​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The research’s insights into open content licensing can be scaled to larger production companies and platforms that are interested in exploring more decentralized production models. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding are strategies that can be expanded to include more ambitious film projects with larger budgets​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The strategies discussed in the study, such as crowdsourcing and open licensing, can be transferred to other creative sectors beyond film, including digital art, music production, and software development​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The research introduces innovative ways to combine crowdfunding, open licensing, and digital distribution to create alternative business models for independent filmmakers. These models challenge the traditional reliance on proprietary distribution systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: The study has the potential to disrupt the mainstream film industry by demonstrating how open content models can be both artistically and financially viable. This disruption is evident in the increasing adoption of non-traditional licensing models and the shift towards more democratic and collaborative production methods​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes sustainable practices in the film industry by advocating for models that reduce reliance on proprietary distribution and maximize the potential for creative reuse. The open content approach ensures that films can continue to generate value long after their initial release​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The research raises important ethical issues around intellectual property rights, fair compensation, and creative freedom. By using Creative Commons licenses, filmmakers can retain control over how their work is used, ensuring that their content remains accessible while protecting against misuse​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability for Independent Filmmakers: The study provides practical strategies for implementing Creative Commons licenses, offering filmmakers a clear framework for distributing their work while retaining some control over its use. The research is also useful for platforms that support open content, helping them refine their business models to better support independent creators​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Policymakers: The findings are also applicable to policymakers who are working on reforming copyright laws to better support open access to creative works​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research impacts not only the film industry but also broader discussions in media studies, intellectual property law, and cultural policy. It provides valuable insights for scholars in various fields, as well as practitioners in creative industries who are exploring alternative distribution and licensing models​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: As digital platforms and global distribution make it easier to reach international audiences, the study’s findings are relevant worldwide. Open content models are particularly valuable in regions where traditional production and distribution infrastructures are underdeveloped​(4).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Adaptability to New Technologies: The study emphasizes the importance of adapting to new digital distribution platforms and crowdsourcing technologies, ensuring that open content filmmakers remain resilient in a rapidly changing media landscape​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Resilience in the Face of Industry Resistance: Despite challenges and resistance from mainstream industry stakeholders, the study shows how open content models continue to evolve and adapt, finding new ways to sustain independent filmmakers​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions shows that the study on open content filmmaking has far-reaching impacts across multiple domains, offering innovative solutions to many of the challenges faced by independent filmmakers while contributing to broader discussions on intellectual property, media policy, and cultural access.
