Based on the provided documents and the analysis of the study titled "Revolution Postponed? Tracing the Development and Limitations of Open Content Filmmaking", the potential research impacts align with several predefined research impact dimensions. These impacts are outlined as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Economic Impact: The research explores alternative business models for filmmaking, particularly focusing on open content models like Creative Commons (CC) licenses. These models impact the economics of film production by proposing new ways to generate revenue, reduce costs, and distribute films. Although the study indicates limitations, it opens pathways for independent filmmakers to explore more sustainable economic strategies by reducing reliance on traditional, closed distribution channels.
Social and Cultural Impact: The study highlights the cultural influence of open content filmmaking by promoting broader public access to creative works. This has the potential to enhance cultural diversity, allowing underrepresented voices in the film industry to reach wider audiences without the constraints imposed by conventional copyright models. The social dimension includes the democratization of cultural production, giving a platform to filmmakers who prioritize accessibility over profit​(3 (1)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediately, the study provides insights into how filmmakers can leverage CC licenses and open content strategies to distribute their films and engage with audiences online. This could impact filmmakers who are looking for rapid alternatives to conventional distribution methods​(Common Research Impact …).
Long-term Impact: Over the long term, the study’s insights into open content filmmaking may contribute to ongoing discussions in media policy and intellectual property rights, potentially influencing future regulations that support more flexible copyright frameworks in the creative industries​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Independent Filmmakers: The most direct beneficiaries are independent filmmakers who adopt open content strategies, helping them bypass traditional gatekeepers in the film industry.
Cultural Institutions and Policymakers: Cultural organizations and policymakers interested in promoting open access to cultural resources could use the study to inform policies aimed at reducing barriers to cultural participation and enhancing public access to creative works​(3 (1)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: The study provides a profound influence within the film and media studies discipline by challenging existing models of intellectual property and offering an alternative framework based on openness and accessibility​(Research impact toolkit).
Breadth of Impact: Beyond filmmaking, the study’s impact extends to other creative industries like music, literature, and digital content creation. It offers insights into how open content models can be applied across different forms of media production​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The proposed open content models can be scaled from small, independent filmmakers to larger production companies and platforms, as they provide a flexible approach to intellectual property management​(Research impact toolkit).
Transferability: The research findings are transferable to other creative sectors, such as digital art, music, and publishing, where open content licenses are increasingly relevant. This cross-disciplinary relevance broadens the study’s impact, influencing a variety of cultural production processes​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Disruption of Traditional Models: The research challenges the conventional closed models of intellectual property, proposing instead the use of Creative Commons licenses to foster a more collaborative and open filmmaking environment. This has the potential to disrupt the traditional commercial film industry by shifting the focus from profit-driven models to more community-oriented approaches​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Technological Innovation: The study also explores how digital platforms and social media can be used to distribute open content films, which represents an innovation in how filmmakers engage with their audiences and generate revenue​(Common Research Impact …).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The research promotes sustainable practices in filmmaking by encouraging the use of open content models, which reduce the financial burden on filmmakers and increase the longevity of creative works by making them accessible to a broader audience​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Ethical Considerations: The study raises important ethical questions about the balance between open access and the ability of filmmakers to earn a living from their work. While open content offers wider access, it may also reduce the economic viability of filmmaking for those who rely on traditional revenue streams​(3 (1))​(impact pathway).
8. Implementation and Usability
Immediate Usability for Filmmakers: The research provides practical tools for filmmakers to immediately implement Creative Commons licenses in their work, offering them an alternative to the conventional copyright system. This can be especially useful for independent filmmakers who seek to distribute their work more freely and engage directly with audiences​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Usability for Policymakers: The study’s findings can also be applied by policymakers looking to revise intellectual property laws to support more open and accessible forms of cultural production​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The findings of this research are relevant across multiple fields, including media studies, intellectual property law, and digital culture. The lessons learned from the open content movement in filmmaking can inform similar efforts in music, publishing, and software development​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Global Relevance: Given the global nature of digital content distribution, the study’s findings are relevant to filmmakers and cultural producers around the world, particularly in regions where access to traditional distribution channels is limited​(impact pathway).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Adaptability to New Technological Platforms: The study emphasizes the importance of adapting to emerging digital platforms for the distribution of open content films. As technology continues to evolve, the flexibility offered by open content models allows filmmakers to remain resilient in a rapidly changing media landscape​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Resilience in the Face of Industry Resistance: Despite challenges and resistance from traditional industry stakeholders, the study shows that open content filmmakers have developed innovative strategies to sustain their work, ensuring resilience even in the face of economic limitations​(3 (1))​(Research impact toolkit).
In conclusion, the study has significant potential research impacts across multiple domains, including economic, social, cultural, and technological areas. By promoting the use of open content models and Creative Commons licenses, the research offers innovative solutions to many of the challenges faced by independent filmmakers, while also contributing to broader discussions on intellectual property, access to culture, and sustainable business models.
