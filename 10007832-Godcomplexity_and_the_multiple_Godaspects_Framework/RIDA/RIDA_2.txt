
Based on the provided study and using the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I have detailed how the research from the article "Measures of God Representations: Theoretical Framework and Critical Review" aligns with each dimension.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "We use this conceptualization to critically review 73 existing measures of God representations... grouped into 4 categories: self-report measures, performance-based measures, structured interview measures, and implicit measures" (Results, Page 342).
Page Reference and Section: Results, Page 342.
Example: The research primarily impacts the academic domain, particularly within psychology, by advancing the measurement of religious and spiritual constructs. It may also influence educational practices related to religious studies and social domains by informing counseling or therapeutic practices in communities where spirituality plays a significant role.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "We make several suggestions for improving measurement in this field" (Discussion, Page 354).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Page 354.
Example: This research has the potential for long-term impact as it provides foundational guidance for future studies in psychology and theology. It offers a framework that other researchers will build on, especially as interest in spiritual psychology grows.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: "We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure and make recommendations regarding their use by researchers and practitioners" (Abstract, Page 341).
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, Page 341.
Example: Direct stakeholders include psychologists, theologians, and researchers who use these measures in their work. Indirect stakeholders could include educators, spiritual counselors, and communities who benefit from improved understanding of spiritual constructs in psychological and social settings.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "We build upon a dual-process conceptualization of God representations" (Methods, Page 342).
Page Reference and Section: Methods, Page 342.
Example: The research has deep impact within the field of psychology of religion, particularly for those studying spirituality and personality. It also has broad implications across fields like religious education, counseling, and mental health, where understanding of God representations can influence treatment and teaching methods.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "We make recommendations regarding their use by researchers and practitioners" (Results, Page 354).
Page Reference and Section: Results, Page 354.
Example: The research framework is transferable to different cultural contexts, as it provides a broad categorization of God representations. It could be adapted for cross-cultural studies or applied in fields such as comparative religion or anthropology, examining spiritual experiences across diverse populations.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "We critically review 73 existing measures of God representations" (Abstract, Page 340).
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, Page 340.
Example: The study is innovative in that it synthesizes and critiques a vast number of measurement tools, providing a clearer framework for future research. However, it is not highly disruptive, as it builds on existing methodologies rather than overturning them.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "We make recommendations regarding the use of these measures by researchers and practitioners" (Discussion, Page 354).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Page 354.
Example: The study promotes ethical research practices by guiding researchers on how to properly use and interpret God representation measures, ensuring that the tools are used in ways that respect individual beliefs and cultural differences.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "We make several suggestions for improving measurement in this field" (Discussion, Page 354).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Page 354.
Example: The recommendations made in the study have high usability for researchers who develop or use psychometric tools in psychology. The categorization of measures and clear discussion of their strengths and limitations make it easier for practitioners to implement these tools in diverse settings, from clinical to educational contexts.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "This dual-process conceptualization... reflects affect-light and affect-laden aspects of spirituality" (Methods, Page 342).
Page Reference and Section: Methods, Page 342.
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by connecting psychology, theology, and cognitive science. It also holds global relevance due to its application in diverse cultural contexts where spiritual beliefs are integral to personal identity and social structure, influencing counseling, education, and mental health care worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure" (Results, Page 342).
Page Reference and Section: Results, Page 342.
Example: The study shows resilience in its potential to remain a useful guide for the development and application of psychometric measures over time. As spiritual practices and the psychology of religion evolve, the framework can adapt to new cultural understandings of spirituality, allowing it to remain relevant across future research.
This breakdown provides a detailed analysis of how the study aligns with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact.
