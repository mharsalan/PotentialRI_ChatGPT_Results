Here is the analysis of the research paper based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The paper primarily impacts the health domain by contributing to performance-based financing (PBF) reforms within health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It also influences policy-making by providing a framework for monitoring and evaluation in health systems, focusing on systemic changes through financial incentives.
Section and Page Reference: Results, Page 2 and 9​(2).
Example: The research influences healthcare policy by offering insights into the use of PBF to improve health service delivery in LMICs, potentially shaping future health system reforms.
Duration of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The framework developed in the paper for monitoring PBF reforms has both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it enhances service delivery by providing immediate tools for evaluation, while in the long term, it contributes to sustainable improvements in health system design and governance.
Section and Page Reference: Discussion, Page 9 .
Example: Short-term impacts include improved health service delivery through targeted financial incentives, while long-term impacts involve the integration of PBF reforms into national health systems, potentially leading to sustained healthcare improvements over decades.
Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The research impacts multiple stakeholders, including government policymakers, healthcare providers, and international development organizations. It specifically addresses the roles of these stakeholders in PBF reform implementation and monitoring.
Section and Page Reference: Background, Page 2; Results, Page 9 .
Example: Policymakers use the findings to design better health financing mechanisms, while healthcare providers benefit from the improved efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery under PBF reforms.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpt: The research has a deep impact within the healthcare domain by advancing knowledge on how financial incentives influence health system performance. It also has a broad impact, as it can be adapted for use in other sectors where performance-based incentives are relevant.
Section and Page Reference: Results, Page 8​(2).
Example: Deep impact occurs within healthcare financing, where the research introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating health reforms, while broad impact is seen in its potential application to other sectors like education or public services.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpt: The paper outlines a scalable framework for PBF reforms, suggesting that the evaluation tools developed can be expanded to other countries and regions. The transferability is evident in the potential application of the framework to different health system structures.
Section and Page Reference: Discussion, Page 9 .
Example: The PBF evaluation framework can be scaled up for use across multiple LMICs, and it is transferable to other sectors, such as education or social services, where performance-based evaluations are needed.
