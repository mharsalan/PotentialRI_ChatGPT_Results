Methods, page 124
Results, page 126
Example:

Direct stakeholders: Indigenous community organizations in urban centers will apply this research to develop land-based wellness programs for youth.
Indirect stakeholders: Government bodies and policymakers can use these findings to integrate Indigenous cultural health determinants into urban health policies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study provides deep insights into Indigenous wellness and how land-based practices can be adapted to urban contexts, enriching both Indigenous health and urban studies fields (Results, page 125).
It crosses disciplinary boundaries, integrating insights from community health, urban planning, and Indigenous studies (Discussion, page 129).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 125
Discussion, page 129
Example:

Deep impact: The research advances the field of Indigenous health, offering new perspectives on urban wellness that are rooted in cultural practices and connections to nature.
Broad impact: By integrating urban planning with Indigenous health, this research can inform city policies that support the mental and physical wellness of urban Indigenous populations.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The methodology and insights from this research can be transferred to other urban Indigenous communities across Canada and globally, as it provides a model for connecting urban youth to cultural practices within city spaces (Results, page 127).
The practices of “land-making” and gift-giving as explored in the study can be scaled to larger urban settings to promote wellness in diverse Indigenous populations (Results, page 126).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, pages 126–127
Example:

Scalability: The practices of urban "land-making" can be scaled up to national or global health programs targeting Indigenous populations in metropolitan areas.
Transferability: The research framework could be adapted for other marginalized groups in urban settings who seek to maintain cultural practices while navigating modern urban life.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research introduces innovative concepts of urban land-making and human-nature relationships, challenging traditional views that land-based practices are only relevant in rural settings (Results, page 126).
It disrupts established health models by proposing a culturally grounded, land-based approach to Indigenous wellness in urban settings (Discussion, page 128).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 126
Discussion, page 128
Example:

Innovation: The concept of “urban land-making” is a novel approach that offers new ways to incorporate cultural traditions into modern urban environments.
Disruption: This research challenges conventional health frameworks by highlighting the importance of integrating cultural and environmental determinants of health in urban Indigenous populations.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The research emphasizes ethical collaboration with Indigenous communities, using community-based participatory research methods that respect Indigenous protocols and worldviews (Methods, page 124).
The focus on environmental repossession and sustaining land-based practices in urban contexts also aligns with sustainable urban development (Discussion, page 128).
Page Reference and Section:

Methods, page 124
Discussion, page 128
Example:

The research promotes sustainability by advocating for land-based practices that reconnect urban Indigenous youth with nature, fostering both environmental and community health.
Ethical considerations are embedded in its collaborative approach, ensuring that Indigenous voices and perspectives guide the research process.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The findings can be directly applied to urban health programs aimed at improving the wellness of Indigenous youth by incorporating land-based cultural practices into health services (Results, page 127).
The research offers practical recommendations for creating urban spaces that facilitate land-making and environmental repossession (Discussion, page 129).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 127
Discussion, page 129
Example:

Usability: Urban health services and community organizations can implement land-based wellness activities in their programs for Indigenous youth, contributing to mental and physical health improvements.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research bridges Indigenous studies, urban planning, and public health, making it relevant across multiple disciplines (Introduction, page 122).
Its findings could be applied globally to urban Indigenous populations facing similar challenges with maintaining cultural identity in city spaces (Discussion, page 128).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, page 122
Discussion, page 128
Example:

The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by influencing fields such as urban health, Indigenous studies, and public policy. It can be adapted to urban Indigenous communities globally, especially in countries with similar colonial histories.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research highlights the resilience of Indigenous youth in maintaining connections to land and nature in urban environments, suggesting that these practices can adapt to different urban contexts (Results, page 125).
The adaptability of traditional land-based practices in urban settings is a central theme, showing how these practices can be modified to fit modern city life (Discussion, page 129).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 125
Discussion, page 129
Example:

The resilience of Indigenous youth is demonstrated through their ability to adapt traditional land-based practices within urban spaces, offering a model for other marginalized groups facing similar challenges in maintaining cultural identity in cities.
