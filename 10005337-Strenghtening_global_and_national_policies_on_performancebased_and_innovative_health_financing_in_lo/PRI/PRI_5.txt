After reviewing the entire text of the study and drawing from the predefined dimensions of research impact, here are several potential research impacts aligned with established frameworks:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
The study on Performance-Based Financing (PBF) in fragile settings like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria directly aims to improve health outcomes. By linking healthcare provider payments to verified outputs, it enhances service delivery in resource-poor, conflict-affected regions.

Example: By improving access to quality healthcare, the study contributes to better maternal and child health outcomes in the regions studied, thus having a direct impact on public health​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
The study provides evidence for how PBF can be adapted to conflict settings, which can inform policy at the national and international levels. It advocates for the integration of flexibility and local stakeholder engagement in health financing models.

Example: Policymakers in fragile states could adopt the flexible, context-specific PBF models proposed by the study, influencing national health financing policies to better cater to fragile and post-conflict settings​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
The research demonstrates how performance-based financing can reduce inefficiencies in health service delivery, which could result in cost savings. Efficient healthcare spending and improved service delivery in conflict zones would have long-term economic benefits by improving public health and reducing the burden on health systems.

Example: Implementation of these findings could reduce healthcare costs by preventing the need for more expensive emergency interventions due to improved primary healthcare​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Social and Cultural Impact
The study has the potential to influence the social structure in fragile regions by changing how healthcare is perceived and accessed. By promoting transparency and accountability through PBF, the study fosters trust in public health institutions.

Example: The empowerment of local health workers and organizations, and the involvement of communities in the healthcare delivery process, could lead to greater social cohesion and improved trust in government institutions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Environmental Impact and Sustainability
Though not the primary focus, the research touches upon the sustainability of healthcare systems in fragile settings. By recommending locally adaptive financing mechanisms, it supports the sustainability of health services in regions that are vulnerable to conflict and resource depletion.

Example: The research proposes adaptable models of financing that can continue to function sustainably even in environmentally degraded or politically unstable regions​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Technological Advancement and Commercialization
While the study doesn't directly address technological innovations, the systems it proposes—such as digital verification of health services and outcomes—could foster advancements in health information systems.

Example: The adoption of digital systems for tracking healthcare delivery and financing in fragile settings could spur further technological development in health management systems, especially in low-resource environments​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
The research contributes to the global understanding of healthcare delivery in fragile and conflict-affected areas, offering a framework that can be adapted and studied in other regions. It adds to the knowledge base regarding health financing models and their adaptability.

Example: The insights from this study could serve as a foundation for future research in health economics, health policy, and post-conflict development strategies​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Public Awareness and Education
By highlighting the challenges of healthcare delivery in fragile settings, the research raises awareness of the needs in these regions and can inform educational campaigns targeting both healthcare professionals and the broader public.

Example: NGOs and international organizations could use the study to inform public awareness campaigns on the importance of sustainable health financing in conflict regions​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
9. Equity and Inclusivity
The study emphasizes the need to address health disparities in conflict-affected settings, proposing solutions that ensure access to healthcare for vulnerable populations, particularly women and children.

Example: The implementation of these PBF models could reduce healthcare inequities by ensuring that marginalized groups, such as women and children in conflict areas, receive the necessary care​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Implementation and Usability
The practical guidelines provided for adapting PBF in fragile contexts make the findings highly usable for governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders working in similar environments. It bridges the gap between theory and practice by offering actionable insights.

Example: The study's recommendations for using flexible organizational structures in PBF can be directly implemented by health service managers and policy designers in conflict settings​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These are the potential impacts of the research, highlighting its wide-ranging effects on health, policy, economics, and social structures in fragile regions. By addressing healthcare financing in conflict-affected areas, the study contributes to improved health outcomes, policy reform, and sustainable development.
