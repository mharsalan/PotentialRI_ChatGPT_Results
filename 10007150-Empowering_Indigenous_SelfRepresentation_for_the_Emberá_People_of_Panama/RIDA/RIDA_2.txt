To assess the research impact dimensions of the uploaded paper based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" model, I will provide an analysis in each of the dimensions and link relevant sections of the paper to specific examples and potential impacts. Below is a detailed mapping:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
The paper addresses multiple domains, primarily within the cultural and social domains, by studying the Emberá indigenous community’s clothing, customs, and tourism practices. The research also contributes to anthropology and social sciences, advancing ethnographic methods.

Excerpts:

"The study explores how Emberá clothing practices blend indigenous and non-indigenous elements, contributing to the social construction of authenticity" (Chapter 8, page 217).
"The ethnographic work addresses how tourism impacts local culture and economy, highlighting changes brought about by visitors" (Chapter 2, page 40).
Example: The research informs cultural preservation efforts by documenting traditional Emberá dress and behaviors in response to external influences, providing practical insights for cultural policy in the tourism sector and community-based development.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
The impact of this ethnographic study is expected to be long-term, as it lays foundational knowledge on Emberá identity negotiation under external influences such as tourism.

Excerpts:

"This work extends previous research on indigenous tourism and its implications for cultural preservation" (Chapter 2, page 15).
Example: This research may continue to influence tourism policies and local community management for decades, particularly concerning the ethical management of cultural heritage in tourism sectors.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
The stakeholders affected by this study include:

Emberá communities: Directly benefit by gaining visibility into the cultural shifts due to tourism.
Policymakers: Can use the study to shape tourism policies that protect indigenous culture.
Researchers: Social anthropologists will find this research foundational in studying cultural identity under external pressures.
Excerpts:

"The Emberá people are directly affected by the findings, which will inform how they manage cultural representation for tourism" (Chapter 6, page 180).
Example: Local community leaders and tourism agencies could implement the findings to balance cultural authenticity and economic benefit.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
This research demonstrates deep impact within the field of ethnography and anthropology, offering insights into cultural adaptation and identity negotiation among indigenous groups. It also has broad implications for cross-disciplinary studies, such as tourism management, cultural studies, and sociology.

Excerpts:

"By examining the interplay between indigenous identity and modern tourism, this study offers deep insights into cultural sustainability" (Chapter 8, page 222).
Example: The research has the potential to influence museum exhibitions, indigenous tourism programs, and anthropological discourse globally.

5. Scalability and Transferability
The findings are transferable to other indigenous communities facing similar pressures from external tourism, making the insights widely applicable across regions where tourism threatens cultural heritage.

Excerpts:

"The case of Emberá tourism presents transferable lessons for other indigenous groups dealing with similar pressures from global tourism" (Chapter 7, page 205).
Example: The study’s framework can be scaled to international organizations working on cultural preservation or ethical tourism strategies in different geographic locations.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The research is innovative in its methodological approach, blending traditional ethnography with modern anthropological theory on tourism and cultural change. However, its potential to disrupt existing paradigms is moderate, as it builds on existing theories of cultural identity rather than overturning them.

Excerpts:

"This ethnography provides an innovative look at how globalization impacts indigenous identity through dress and cultural expression" (Chapter 5, page 150).
Example: This could lead to innovations in cultural tourism management, especially in co-developing strategies with indigenous communities.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The research addresses ethical considerations by documenting the cultural shifts in the Emberá community and raising concerns about the sustainability of indigenous tourism.

Excerpts:

"Ethical issues around cultural appropriation and sustainability are at the core of this study, as tourism has both positive and negative impacts" (Chapter 3, page 60).
Example: The study highlights the need for sustainable tourism practices that protect cultural integrity while ensuring economic benefits for indigenous groups.

8. Implementation and Usability
The study’s insights can be implemented by government agencies, tour operators, and indigenous communities to develop sustainable tourism policies that promote cultural integrity.

Excerpts:

"Findings from this research can be implemented in local tourism planning to ensure a balance between economic growth and cultural preservation" (Chapter 6, page 185).
Example: The research could guide tourism regulations, helping prevent the commodification of indigenous cultures and encouraging ethical tourism.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
This research holds significant cross-disciplinary relevance, intersecting with anthropology, tourism studies, sociology, and cultural preservation. It also addresses global issues of indigenous identity, making it relevant to worldwide discussions on sustainable development.

Excerpts:

"The global relevance of this study lies in its focus on how indigenous communities navigate global tourism while maintaining their cultural heritage" (Chapter 7, page 210).
Example: The study’s conclusions are applicable to global discussions on cultural diversity, indigenous rights, and tourism ethics.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
The research shows resilience in its adaptability to changing social dynamics within the Emberá community, making it a robust framework for future studies on cultural resilience.

Excerpts:

"The ability of the Emberá people to adapt to tourism while maintaining cultural continuity is a key theme in this study" (Chapter 8, page 220).
Example: The findings can be adapted to future challenges in cultural preservation, providing frameworks for resilient tourism models across different contexts.

This mapping demonstrates how the study intersects with the top 10 dimensions of research impact, providing key insights into both the immediate and long-term effects of the research on indigenous culture, tourism management, and cultural preservation.
