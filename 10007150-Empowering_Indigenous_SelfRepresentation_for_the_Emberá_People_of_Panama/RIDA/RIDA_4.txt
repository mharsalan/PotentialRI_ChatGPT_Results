Here is the research impact dimension analysis of the study, based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The research primarily impacts cultural and social domains by examining the role of dance in Emberá communities, which helps shape self-representation and cultural awareness (Discussion, Page 125). It also provides insights into the economic domain, as tourism and dance performances are integrated into the local economy, supporting community livelihoods (Results, Page 125).
Example: The research enhances cultural representation and economic strategies through indigenous tourism, helping local communities preserve and promote their culture while earning income from tourism.
Duration of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The long-term impact is seen in how tourism has transformed traditional cultural expressions like dance into a sustained economic strategy (Discussion, Page 123). Short-term impacts are observed in the immediate benefits of tourism for income generation within the community (Results, Page 125).
Example: The study’s findings on tourism’s role in preserving culture may lead to both short-term benefits (immediate income) and long-term cultural preservation and awareness.
Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: Key stakeholders include the local Emberá community, who benefit economically and culturally from tourism, as well as tourists who engage with and learn from these performances (Results, Page 123). Researchers and policymakers interested in indigenous representation are indirect stakeholders.
Example: The community benefits directly by participating in tourism, while policymakers and cultural researchers can use the findings to advocate for policies supporting indigenous tourism.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: The study has a deep impact within the field of cultural anthropology, providing specific insights into the self-representation of indigenous people through dance (Results, Page 123). Its breadth extends to global discussions on cultural tourism and indigenous rights (Discussion, Page 124).
Example: It deeply influences anthropological discourse on indigenous cultures and broadly informs the global tourism industry's best practices in cultural representation.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: The research findings are scalable, as similar approaches could be adapted to other indigenous communities engaging with tourism (Discussion, Page 124). The insights on dance as a cultural and economic tool are transferable to other cultural tourism initiatives.
Example: The framework of using dance in tourism to support community income could be applied to other indigenous groups globally, promoting cultural sustainability.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: The research introduces innovative ideas about tourism as a means of preserving indigenous culture rather than eroding it (Discussion, Page 125). It disrupts traditional views of tourism as exploitative by showing it can be a tool for cultural empowerment.
Example: This research challenges conventional ideas about indigenous tourism, offering a new model where communities retain control and benefit culturally and economically.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts: Ethical concerns are addressed by showing how tourism can contribute to the sustainability of the Emberá culture while providing economic benefits (Results, Page 125). The research emphasizes the need for ethical tourism that respects indigenous autonomy and traditions (Discussion, Page 124).
Example: The research promotes sustainable tourism practices that ensure the longevity of indigenous cultures while providing economic stability.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts: The usability of the research lies in its practical applications for developing sustainable tourism models that benefit indigenous communities without compromising their cultural integrity (Results, Page 125).
Example: This research could guide local governments and NGOs in implementing tourism projects that are both economically viable and culturally respectful.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts: The research integrates anthropology, economics, and tourism studies, highlighting its cross-disciplinary relevance (Discussion, Page 123). Its global relevance lies in its potential application to other indigenous communities worldwide engaged in tourism (Results, Page 125).
Example: The study's findings can influence global discussions on sustainable tourism, indigenous rights, and cultural preservation.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts: The adaptability of the research is reflected in how it addresses changing dynamics in tourism and culture, showing that the Emberá have adapted their traditional practices to fit new economic realities (Discussion, Page 125).
Example: The resilience of the research lies in its potential to inform long-term tourism strategies that can evolve with the changing needs of indigenous communities and tourist preferences.
