Based on the text from the uploaded file, I will now assess the research study according to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism has the potential to deeply shape the political representation of Indigenous societies, and as such deserves special attention as a distinctive variant of cultural tourism" (Page 99).
Example: The study highlights that Indigenous tourism affects the cultural and political domains by promoting local representation, allowing the community to define their identity outside of national narratives. This contributes to the understanding of cultural tourism’s role in political and social empowerment.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism provides opportunities for developing cultural representation at the local level, often by calling attention to cultural difference" (Page 100).
Example: The impact of this research is likely to be long-term as it helps shape how Indigenous communities in Panama and beyond engage with tourism, thus fostering cultural sustainability and political autonomy over time.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "I approach Indigenous tourism as a transformative process that inspires the Emberá to experiment and creatively develop pre-existing cultural practices" (Page 99).
Example: The direct stakeholders of this research are Indigenous communities like the Emberá, as well as policymakers involved in cultural tourism and conservation. Indirect stakeholders include tourists who experience the authentic representation of the Emberá culture.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism... provides opportunities for developing cultural representation at the local level" (Page 100).
Example: The depth of the impact is evident in the transformation of the Emberá community’s self-representation and cultural practices, while the research has broader implications for the field of cultural tourism, influencing policies and practices globally.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Even in nations where multiculturalism is promoted as an official discourse, Indigenous tourism may encourage the articulation of Indigenous identity in previously unexplored directions" (Page 102).
Example: The research has high transferability as the concept of Indigenous tourism as a tool for cultural and political empowerment can be applied in various global contexts, particularly in regions with marginalized Indigenous communities.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism as a transformative process... to articulate their identity to audiences of outsiders" (Page 99).
Example: This research disrupts conventional ideas about tourism by focusing on Indigenous control of cultural narratives, challenging the homogenizing effects of mainstream tourism industries.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism... encourages the articulation of Indigenous identity in previously unexplored directions" (Page 102).
Example: The research promotes cultural sustainability by helping Indigenous communities like the Emberá maintain and evolve their cultural identity while engaging ethically with tourism.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The Emberá experiment and creatively develop pre-existing cultural practices" (Page 99).
Example: The findings can be used by policymakers and tourism developers to design culturally sensitive tourism models that respect Indigenous traditions while enhancing economic opportunities.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism provides opportunities for developing cultural representation at the local level, often by calling attention to cultural difference" (Page 100).
Example: The research is relevant globally as it intersects anthropology, tourism studies, and cultural policy, offering insights that can be applied to Indigenous tourism efforts in other parts of the world.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "Indigenous tourism... encourages the articulation of Indigenous identity in previously unexplored directions" (Page 102).
Example: The adaptability of this research is evident in its relevance to different Indigenous communities. As tourism evolves, these findings can help other communities adapt to new economic and social circumstances while preserving their cultural integrity.
These are the key insights from the research based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact framework, providing a detailed mapping of its broader effects.
