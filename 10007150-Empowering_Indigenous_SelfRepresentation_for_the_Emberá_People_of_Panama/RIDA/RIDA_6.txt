The study presented in "Embera Indigenous Tourism and the World of Expectations" primarily explores how the Embera community in Panama engages with tourism and navigates the expectations of tourists. The focus is on how these interactions impact their cultural identity and representation. Let's break this down across the top 10 dimensions of research impact based on your request:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The engagement of the Embera with tourism, and their attempts to understand and anticipate tourist expectations, has inspired a process of self-reevaluation of Embera culture, providing new opportunities for the Embera to improvise and experiment with their cultural representation." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research impacts the cultural and social domains by exploring how indigenous communities like the Embera adapt their cultural representations for tourists. It also touches on the economic domain, as tourism serves as an economic activity. This study highlights how tourism-induced cultural adaptations influence both the representation of indigenous culture and the community’s economic sustainability.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Tourist expectations, as they are offered to the Embera, are diverse and often contradictory... leading the Embera to slightly underplay or accentuate their cultural difference." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research has long-term impacts as it influences the evolving identity of the Embera people. The way they reinterpret their culture for tourists will likely shape their cultural and economic landscape for years to come. The short-term impact is observed in immediate adaptations made during tourist interactions.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Most tourists depart from Parara Puru worn out from the tropical heat, but exhilarated from the experience." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: Direct stakeholders include the Embera community, who benefit economically and socially from tourism. Indirect stakeholders include the tourists, who gain cultural understanding and insight into indigenous lifestyles, as well as Panamanian NGOs and tourism agencies, which support the infrastructure for tourism.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The interaction of expectations during the tourism exchange in Parara Puru is a dynamic and creative process that has inspired creative adaptations." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research has deep impact within the fields of anthropology and cultural studies, providing new insights into how indigenous communities navigate external expectations. It also has broad impact as it intersects with tourism studies, economic development, and postcolonial studies.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "Parara Puru... was founded nine years ago by an initial core-group of Embera who wanted to work full-time in tourism. They established a small but vibrant and economically successful community." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The tourism model developed by the Embera community is scalable, potentially serving as a model for other indigenous communities engaging in cultural tourism. The approach is transferable to other contexts where indigenous communities interact with external cultural expectations.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The success of the tourism-experiment was immediate and profitable to both the Embera and the tourist agents." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research demonstrates innovation by showing how the Embera community reinterprets their traditional culture in response to tourism. This represents a shift in how indigenous communities manage their cultural heritage in modern economies. The disruption potential is in how indigenous culture, often seen as static, is shown to be dynamic and adaptable.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The proximity of Chagres to the Canal and Panama City made possible the growth of tourism activities." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research examines the sustainability of the tourism model, considering both the economic benefits for the Embera and the cultural sustainability in how their traditions are maintained or adapted. There are ethical considerations surrounding the commercialization of indigenous culture and the balance between authenticity and economic gain.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The Embera are curious to learn more about their guests and how they obtain an understanding of their guests’ expectations." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: This research provides practical insights for tourism agencies and cultural preservation organizations, highlighting how indigenous communities can interact with tourists. It demonstrates a usable model for managing cultural tourism while maintaining community autonomy and agency.

9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Through daily interaction, the Embera recognize the ethnic categories of tourists that visit their community." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance, influencing fields such as anthropology, sociology, tourism, and global studies. The adaptability of the Embera in managing tourism expectations has global relevance, as similar dynamics occur in indigenous communities worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The tourist expectations... have significantly changed, from stereotyping in the past to idealized admiration in the present." (Chapter 3, page 71)

Page Reference: Chapter 3, page 71.

Example: The research highlights the resilience and adaptability of the Embera people in facing external pressures. The community’s ability to navigate and integrate diverse expectations while maintaining elements of their cultural identity showcases their adaptability in the face of changing global dynamics.
