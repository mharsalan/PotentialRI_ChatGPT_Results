Let's break down the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Emberá Indigenous Tourism and the Trap of Authenticity: Beyond Inauthenticity and Invention" by Dimitrios Theodossopoulos, based on the top 10 dimensions of research impact as outlined:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study contributes to multiple domains by addressing how indigenous tourism impacts not only the Emberá community’s cultural practices but also the wider academic discussions on authenticity, tourism, and cultural commodification. "Tourists' search for an authenticity uncorrupted by modernity inspires indigenous articulations of the authentic related to diverse sets of cultural practices..." (Introduction, p. 397).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 397. Example: This research has implications in the social domain by shaping how communities and tourists engage with indigenous identities. It also affects the cultural domain, as it helps preserve and transform indigenous traditions in response to external perceptions of authenticity.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study's long-term impact lies in its contribution to understanding the evolution of cultural representation. It challenges static notions of authenticity, arguing for a "proccessual vision of authenticity" (Introduction, p. 398).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 398. Example: Long-term impact: The research will likely influence future studies in anthropology and tourism by providing a more nuanced understanding of authenticity in indigenous tourism. It has foundational importance for the ongoing discussions on cultural preservation and transformation.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research directly benefits indigenous communities, anthropologists, and tourism professionals by providing insight into how indigenous people negotiate their cultural representation in the tourism industry. It also indirectly benefits policy-makers involved in cultural heritage preservation. "The Emberá's use of minimal clothing in particular...elicits the exoticized predispositions of tourists" (Discussion, p. 401).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 401. Example: The direct stakeholders include the Emberá community, which uses this research to navigate external perceptions. Indirectly, it also benefits policymakers who aim to regulate and preserve cultural heritage in the context of tourism.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research offers deep impact within the field of anthropology by fundamentally challenging the binary of authenticity and inauthenticity in indigenous tourism, and a broad impact by touching on issues of identity, cultural representation, and globalization. "Cultural traditions, such as those presented to tourists by the Emberá, involve 'continual recreation'..." (Discussion, p. 400).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 400. Example: Deep impact: The study significantly advances theoretical understanding in anthropology and cultural studies. Broad impact: It extends beyond academia to influence tourism practices and the management of cultural heritage.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The insights from this research can be transferred to other contexts where indigenous communities engage with tourism, and scaled to broader tourism markets. "In Emberá indigenous tourism, I identify the articulation of more than one authenticity in tension..." (Introduction, p. 398).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 398. Example: Transferability: The findings could apply to indigenous tourism in other global contexts where similar authenticity dilemmas arise, such as in Southeast Asia or Africa. Scalability: The study's framework on authenticity could be expanded to shape larger policies on cultural tourism globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The research disrupts conventional approaches to understanding authenticity in tourism by proposing that there are multiple, evolving forms of authenticity rather than a single, static one. "My approach relies on the recognition of several emerging, parallel manifestations of authenticity..." (Introduction, p. 398).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 398. Example: Disruption potential: The study changes the traditional academic discourse on authenticity in tourism, offering a new framework that challenges established binaries and inspires innovative approaches in both research and tourism practices.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research engages with ethical concerns around the commodification of indigenous culture in tourism. It critiques the oversimplification of Emberá culture for tourist consumption, encouraging sustainable tourism that respects indigenous agency. "The inhabitants of Parara Puru trace the authentic in both past and present practices..." (Introduction, p. 398).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 398. Example: The research promotes ethical tourism practices by highlighting how indigenous communities like the Emberá balance cultural preservation with economic survival, calling for sustainability in cultural representation.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The findings are usable for tourism professionals and policymakers involved in cultural heritage preservation and anthropologists studying indigenous peoples. "The resulting complexity in the dress choices of the Emberá can help us appreciate that the fluid adaptations of indigenous dress cannot be confined..." (Discussion, p. 401).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 401. Example: The research can be implemented in tourism strategies that promote responsible and respectful cultural engagement, as well as in educational programs for tourists to increase awareness about the complexities of cultural authenticity.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance by connecting anthropology, tourism studies, and cultural heritage management. Its global relevance stems from its examination of how global tourism industries interact with local indigenous cultures. "In the case of Emberá indigenous tourism, the tourists' search for authenticity...inspires indigenous articulations..." (Introduction, p. 397).

Page Reference: Introduction, page 397. Example: The research is relevant not just in anthropology but also in global tourism and cultural studies, influencing how cultural preservation and tourism policies are shaped worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study highlights the resilience of the Emberá culture as it adapts to the pressures of tourism while maintaining its authenticity. "The Emberá demonstrate that Parara Puru has all the above and is 'like most other Emberá communities'..." (Discussion, p. 406).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 406. Example: The resilience of the Emberá in negotiating cultural representation in tourism shows their adaptability to modern challenges while maintaining cultural integrity.

These dimensions provide a comprehensive analysis of the research's impact across multiple domains, emphasizing its global relevance and long-term implications for indigenous tourism and cultural studies.
