Excerpts: The study presents key findings that contribute to multiple domains such as environmental sustainability, policy frameworks, and educational reform by addressing [specific themes in the study].

Page Reference: Methods and Results section (p. X)
Example: If the research focused on coral reef conservation, it would influence not only environmental domains but also public policy and educational initiatives regarding biodiversity.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The potential short-term impact of the study includes [an immediate application, such as policy recommendations or health interventions]. Long-term impacts might influence foundational knowledge in the environmental sciences over decades.

Page Reference: Discussion, p. X
Example: In the case of renewable energy solutions, short-term benefits may include rapid adoption of new technologies, while long-term effects could shape sustainable energy policies for decades.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include researchers, environmental agencies, and policy-makers who benefit from the evidence-based recommendations. Indirect stakeholders include local communities and future generations who experience the downstream effects of policy changes.

Page Reference: Results and Discussion, p. X
Example: An environmental policy study can directly benefit policy-makers while indirectly benefiting the public by reducing pollution and improving health outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study provides deep insights into specific areas, such as climate modeling or biodiversity conservation, while its breadth extends to informing policy and education across multiple disciplines.

Page Reference: Results, p. X
Example: Deep impact within environmental sciences may lead to improved coral reef conservation methods, while the breadth of the impact extends to global climate policy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings are scalable, particularly in environmental solutions, as the techniques proposed could be applied in diverse ecosystems worldwide. The methods are also transferable to different geographic regions or sectors, such as agriculture or urban planning.

Page Reference: Discussion, p. X
Example: Techniques developed for one region's reforestation efforts could be transferred to other regions facing deforestation.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research introduces innovative conservation methods or policy approaches that have the potential to disrupt current practices. For instance, [a new technology or approach mentioned in the research].

Page Reference: Results and Discussion, p. X
Example: Disruptive innovations like carbon capture technologies could revolutionize how industries manage emissions.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Sustainability is a core focus, with the study promoting long-term environmental and economic solutions. Ethical considerations include [mention specific ethical issues like data privacy or fairness].

Page Reference: Discussion, p. X
Example: Research on sustainable agricultural practices ensures that future food systems are resilient while also addressing ethical concerns about fair access to resources.
8. Implementation and Usability
