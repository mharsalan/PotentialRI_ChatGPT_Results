To assess the research impact dimensions of the study from the file you provided, I will follow the framework laid out in the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" based on the guidelines you shared.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study examines Ted Hughes's notion of shamanic healing, connecting his poetic work to deeper cultural and psychological healing processes. "Hughes uses the model of the social function of the shaman, about which he must have first learned in his anthropological studies at Cambridge. But he believed that he was prepared for this role in his boyhood identification with the animal world and his teenage infatuation with folklore." (Page 19).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 19.
Example: This research primarily impacts the cultural and academic domains, influencing how Hughes’s poetry is understood as a form of psychological healing and shamanic practice. It contributes to literary criticism and enhances understanding in fields such as anthropology, psychology, and literary studies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The fierceness with which Hughes expresses...represents the mind disconnected from 'the primitive human animal'...what Hughes has been speaking of is the possibility of poetry as a cultural healing that is ultimately also an ecological reconciliation" (Page 20).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 20.
Example: The long-term impact of this research is its foundational contribution to studies of literature, culture, and psychological healing. It creates ongoing influence by offering a lens through which future scholars can analyze Hughes’s works in relation to environmental and ecological themes.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Poetry is forever trying to do the work of religion – as local 'healers' are perpetually setting up as an alternative to orthodox Medicine." (Page 17).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 17.
Example: Stakeholders include academics, literary critics, and psychologists who study the intersection between literature and healing. Additionally, cultural institutions, such as museums and literary societies, would benefit from the enhanced understanding of Hughes’s poetic themes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "For both Blake and Hughes, Ficino’s teachings about the essential power of the imagination and poetry to link us to the source of creative energies...remained of utmost importance." (Page 12).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 12.
Example: The research has deep impact in the field of literary studies, particularly in understanding Hughes’s work through the lens of shamanic healing and its connections to ecological and psychological themes. It also has broad impact across disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, and environmental studies, as it touches on ecological reconciliation and psychological well-being.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "In this role, the artist acts as a psychic healer whose function is recognisably that which anthropologists identify as the shaman." (Page 19).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 19.
Example: The concepts explored in this research are highly transferable to other domains of artistic and literary analysis. The study’s framework on shamanic healing could be applied to other poets or writers with similar themes, enhancing the scalability of the research.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The only natural cure that has ever appeared is art – and particularly poetry, and particularly the poetic world which opens to the psychic healers which have come to be known as shamans." (Page 19).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 19.
Example: The research offers innovative insights by connecting Hughes’s poetry with shamanism, which disrupts traditional literary critiques by introducing a cross-disciplinary framework that includes anthropology and psychology.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The shamanic notion of art as a cultural healing that is also a personal healing requires examining in more detail." (Page 14).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 14.
Example: The study aligns with sustainability as it touches on ecological themes in Hughes’s work, emphasizing the need for psychological and environmental healing, which are long-term ethical considerations in both cultural and ecological contexts.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "Hughes believed that the meaning-making sign-systems of poetry survived precisely because of their potential to heal our alienation from the organic environment." (Page 13).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 13.
Example: The research can be implemented in educational programs and literature courses focusing on the therapeutic role of poetry and its connection to environmental and psychological healing.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Ecofeminists will notice that that capitalisation indicates a reification." (Page 13).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 13.
Example: The research crosses into anthropology, psychology, environmental studies, and literary criticism, demonstrating its global relevance in addressing both cultural and ecological concerns.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Much of culture, it seemed to Hughes, including the literary criticism of poetry, represents the mind disconnected from 'the primitive human animal'." (Page 20).
Section: Hughes’s Notion of Shamanic Healing, Page 20.
Example: The research offers resilient frameworks for understanding literature in connection with healing, which can be adapted to various future studies on different literary figures and ecological concerns.
These dimensions provide a comprehensive view of the research's impact across multiple sectors and fields.
