I have reviewed the research impact dimensions provided in your text, and I can now assess the attached study based on these dimensions. Below, I will apply the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" to the study presented in your document:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study on Ted Hughes' time in East Yorkshire during his National Service impacts multiple domains, particularly the literary domain by deepening the understanding of Hughes' work and the historical domain by illuminating the experience of conscription in post-war Britain.
Page Reference: Page 86, "This is a period of his life only glanced at by critics and biographers..."
Example: The research enriches academic knowledge in literature, history, and biography, particularly around the less-explored periods of Ted Hughes' life, offering new perspectives on his literary influences during his National Service.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The research offers a long-term impact by contributing to the foundational knowledge of Ted Hughes' formative years. His experiences in East Yorkshire are shown to have shaped his literary identity, which would influence his career in the years to come.
Page Reference: Page 91, "These were two formative years between school and university in which Hughes was able to swim further and further out from the landmass of English literature and culture."
Example: The long-term impact of this research lies in its potential to reshape biographical accounts of Hughes, influencing future scholarship in literary studies and British cultural history.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: Key stakeholders include literary scholars, historians, and educational institutions that study the life and works of Ted Hughes. The research may also be valuable for biographers and students of British literature and post-war cultural studies.
Page Reference: Page 87, "It would be easy to accept Ted Hughes’ memorable description of his National Service as a time when he had ‘nothing to do but read and reread Shakespeare’."
Example: Researchers in British literature and history can directly benefit from the insights offered, while students and educators will gain a deeper understanding of how conscription influenced Hughes' literary works.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research has deep impact within the field of Hughes studies by offering new insights into a relatively unexplored part of his life. It also has broad impact by contributing to the broader understanding of post-war British culture and literature.
Page Reference: Page 90, "In one letter to Edna Wholey, Hughes writes vividly about a particularly hair-raising trek across the field to his hut."
Example: The deep impact lies in advancing Hughes' scholarship, while the broad impact crosses over into British history, affecting how post-war conscription is studied and understood in cultural contexts.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: While the study is specific to Ted Hughes' National Service, the themes explored—such as the effects of conscription on personal development—can be transferred to other literary figures or historical contexts.
Page Reference: Page 92, "National Service was the first time he lived away from those circumstances... falling into a distinctly Celtic friendship group."
Example: The transferability of the research can apply to studies of other authors influenced by war or conscription, and scalable findings may influence how conscription's impact on creative minds is taught in literature and history curricula.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The study introduces an innovative approach by using biographical details to examine Hughes' literary works through the lens of his military service, which has been under-explored.
Page Reference: Page 93, "Hughes had been trained as a ‘Ground Wireless Mechanic’, responsible for the ‘care and maintenance of transmitting and receiving gear’."
Example: The study disrupts traditional approaches to Hughes' biography by emphasizing the influence of his National Service, encouraging future biographical studies to consider the impact of seemingly mundane life experiences.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: Ethical considerations in the study revolve around preserving the cultural and literary heritage of one of Britain’s most influential poets while maintaining accuracy and fairness in representing his life experiences.
Page Reference: Page 95, "Mayday on Holderness represents a far more consequential turn."
Example: The research contributes to the sustainability of literary history by preserving knowledge about Hughes’ lesser-known experiences, ensuring that future generations can access a fuller account of his life.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The findings of this study can be implemented in literary studies courses, as well as in biographies, documentaries, or museum exhibitions that explore Ted Hughes' life and work.
Page Reference: Page 94, "What, then, of Hughes’s literary output from this period? A small number of poems can be traced back to his time in East Yorkshire."
Example: The research is highly usable in educational settings, enhancing curriculum content related to British literature, history, and the cultural impact of military service on creative figures.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by linking literary studies with history, military studies, and cultural analysis.
Page Reference: Page 92, "Clearly this was a period in which Hughes gathered together the interests and instincts of his teenage years."
Example: The study's examination of Hughes’ development during his National Service offers global relevance for understanding how military experiences influence creative individuals, relevant for scholars across disciplines and geographies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study shows resilience by revisiting a period of Ted Hughes' life that has been overlooked, and it adapts his narrative to explore new aspects of his literary development.
Page Reference: Page 91, "With two intermediary years well away from curricula, away from guided reading..."
Example: The study enhances the adaptability of Ted Hughes’ biography by shedding light on his National Service, thus contributing to future works that may re-examine similar life periods for other authors.
These detailed assessments align the study with the research impact dimensions provided, showcasing its relevance across multiple sectors and its potential for broad academic and societal influence.
