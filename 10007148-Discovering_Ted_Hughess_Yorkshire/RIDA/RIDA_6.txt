Based on the analysis of the report titled Navigating Inclusion in Peace Settlements: Human Rights and the Creation of the Common Good, I will now map the research impact dimensions to the findings of the study as per the framework of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"This report focuses on how peace settlements, while successful at resolving immediate conflicts, often fail to establish a long-lasting political order that serves the common good" (Executive Summary, p. 2).
"The relationship between human rights and peace settlements has evolved, with an emphasis on rights enabling ongoing struggles for inclusion and broader social claims" (Results, p. 17).

Executive Summary (p. 2), Results (p. 17)
Example: This research impacts the policy domain by recommending strategies for better implementation of human rights in peace settlements, with implications for conflict resolution processes globally.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Peace agreements often institutionalize political unsettlement, leaving the root causes of conflicts unresolved... Human rights assurances offer long-term entry points for struggles of inclusion" (Executive Summary, p. 3).
"It suggests a continuous process of including marginalized groups post-settlement, implying a long-term impact on governance structures" (Discussion, p. 54).
Page Reference and Section:

Executive Summary (p. 3), Discussion (p. 54)
Example: The long-term impact of this research lies in shaping future peace processes by embedding human rights commitments, fostering continuous improvements in political inclusivity.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The report’s recommendations for ongoing international support during and after peace settlements highlight the role of international interveners, civil society, and marginalized groups" (Policy Recommendations, p. 3).
"Local actors are key in translating human rights into practice, with support from international legal frameworks" (Methods, p. 18).
Page Reference and Section:

Policy Recommendations (p. 3), Methods (p. 18)
Example: The direct stakeholders include international organizations and policymakers who benefit from these insights to create more inclusive peace settlements. Indirect stakeholders are marginalized groups whose inclusion could improve post-conflict governance.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"While the report’s focus is on political settlements, its implications for human rights extend across legal, political, and social dimensions" (Introduction, p. 5).

Example: The breadth of impact is broad, as this research influences legal frameworks, governance, and social inclusion, transcending the conflict resolution field.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Recommendations for joint international and local actor analysis provide scalable solutions for conflict-prone regions" (Discussion, p. 54).
"Insights from Bosnia, Burundi, and Nepal are transferable to other fragile states in their approaches to inclusion in peace processes" (Case Studies, p. 25).

Discussion (p. 54), Case Studies (p. 25)
Example: The scalability of recommendations allows them to be applied in various conflict-affected regions, while their transferability makes them adaptable to other governance and human rights contexts globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"A more political approach to human rights is advocated, moving away from traditional liberal peacebuilding frameworks to more innovative, context-sensitive solutions" (Results, p. 19).
Page Reference and Section:

Results (p. 19)
Example: This research disrupts traditional peacebuilding by offering innovative frameworks for continuous inclusion and adaptive governance structures post-conflict.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Human rights frameworks are central to sustaining peace efforts and addressing ongoing exclusion in post-conflict societies" (Discussion, p. 54).
"The report emphasizes ethical considerations in the partnership between international actors and local communities" (Methods, p. 18).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion (p. 54), Methods (p. 18)
Example: The research underscores the sustainability of peace efforts by embedding human rights in governance, ensuring long-term stability and ethical engagement with local communities.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Proposes continuous international support for post-agreement mediation and conflict-dynamics analysis, making the research actionable" (Executive Summary, p. 3).
"Offers models for direct engagement with marginalized groups during political transitions" (Policy Recommendations, p. 19).
Page Reference and Section:

Executive Summary (p. 3), Policy Recommendations (p. 19)

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The concept of ‘formalized political unsettlement’ implies adaptability in peace processes, as conflicts are not fully resolved but transformed" (Executive Summary, p. 2).
"Human rights commitments create adaptable entry points for ongoing struggles for inclusion" (Conclusion, p. 54).
Page Reference and Section:

Executive Summary (p. 2), Conclusion (p. 54)
