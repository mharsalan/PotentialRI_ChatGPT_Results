Based on the study "Navigating Inclusion in Peace Settlements: Human Rights and the Creation of the Common Good," several potential research impacts can be identified, aligning with the research impact dimensions outlined in the frameworks provided. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Policy Domain: The study provides direct recommendations on peace settlements, influencing international and national peace policies. Its focus on how human rights contribute to the creation of a common good offers insights that can shape governmental and intergovernmental approaches to conflict resolution and post-conflict governance.
Example: Policymakers can adopt these findings to design more inclusive peace processes that address the root causes of conflict, fostering long-term peacebuilding.
Social Domain: The research emphasizes inclusion and rights-based approaches, which can significantly affect social structures, especially in post-conflict societies. It proposes frameworks that include marginalized groups in political processes, thus potentially reducing social inequalities.
Example: Advocacy groups and civil society organizations could leverage this study to push for reforms that promote inclusivity in post-conflict political systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact: The study offers immediate applicability for ongoing peace negotiations by providing concrete recommendations for embedding human rights in peace processes.
Long-Term Impact: The study suggests sustainable models for inclusion that have long-term implications for governance and human rights practices. Over time, the adoption of these models could transform post-conflict societies and their governance structures, offering lasting peace​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Policymakers, international organizations (like the UN), and peace negotiators are the primary stakeholders who can directly use the study's findings to inform their peace-building strategies.
Indirect Stakeholders: Marginalized and conflict-affected communities stand to benefit from more inclusive governance models that emerge from the implementation of the research's recommendations​(impact pathway).
Example: Governments and international bodies negotiating peace settlements can utilize these frameworks to ensure marginalized groups are included in governance.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study's deep impact lies within the field of peace and conflict resolution, providing new frameworks for understanding the role of human rights in creating inclusive political orders.
Broad Impact: Beyond conflict resolution, the research’s impact spans multiple sectors, including social policy, international relations, and human rights law. Its relevance to global governance frameworks means it can be applied across diverse post-conflict scenarios globally​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The recommendations on human rights and inclusion are scalable across different post-conflict regions. While initially focused on a few case studies, the principles can be applied to a broad range of contexts, from small local conflicts to larger international peace processes.
Transferability: The frameworks developed in the study are highly transferable to other sectors, such as international development and legal reforms, particularly in countries dealing with post-conflict recovery​(impact pathway).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study offers an innovative approach by challenging traditional peace-building models, proposing instead a dynamic and inclusive framework that prioritizes human rights throughout peace processes. This disrupts conventional conflict resolution methods that often overlook marginalized voices in post-conflict governance​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The focus on human rights as a means to achieve sustainable peace introduces ethical considerations in peace settlements, ensuring that any agreements respect the dignity and inclusion of all societal groups, particularly the most vulnerable. This promotes both the ethical alignment and sustainability of peace agreements​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Implementation and Usability
The study provides practical recommendations for governments, international organizations, and peace negotiators on how to implement inclusive peace processes. Its models for continued inclusion beyond peace settlements offer actionable frameworks that can be adopted in real-world conflict resolution settings​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
The study’s insights cross disciplinary boundaries, affecting fields like law, political science, human rights, and international relations. Its global relevance is underscored by its application to different countries and conflict contexts, from Bosnia to Nepal​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study’s frameworks are adaptable to changing political landscapes in post-conflict societies, ensuring that peace settlements remain relevant even as political and social dynamics evolve. Its resilience lies in its ability to propose flexible solutions that can be adjusted based on local needs​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
The research promotes equity by advocating for the inclusion of marginalized groups in peace settlements, ensuring that their voices are heard in political transitions. This can potentially reduce political and social inequalities, fostering more just and equitable governance systems in post-conflict societies​(impact pathway).
12. Public Awareness and Education
Through its dissemination, the study can raise awareness about the importance of inclusive peace processes. Educational institutions and think tanks can incorporate these findings into curricula and workshops to educate future peace negotiators and policymakers​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
13. Policy Influence and Advocacy
This study has significant potential to shape future policies around peace settlements. Its recommendations on human rights and inclusion could influence both local and international legislation aimed at resolving conflicts and promoting sustainable peace​(Research Impact Knowled…).
14. Social and Cultural Impact
By promoting the inclusion of diverse groups in political processes, the study has the potential to alter societal norms and values around governance and conflict resolution. It advocates for a culture of inclusivity, transforming how societies approach post-conflict recovery​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These potential impacts demonstrate how the study extends beyond academic insights to influence policy, social structures, and international frameworks, particularly in the realms of human rights and conflict resolution.
