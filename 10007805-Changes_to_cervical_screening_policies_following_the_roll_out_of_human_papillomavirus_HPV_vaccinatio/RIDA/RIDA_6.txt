Based on the study titled "HPV Immunisation and Cervical Screening" from the file you provided, here is a dimension-by-dimension assessment of the research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study focuses on the impact of HPV immunisation on cervical screening performance, particularly in the healthcare and public health domain. "The lower incidence of disease in vaccinated women alters the key performance indicators of cervical cytology used to monitor the quality of the screening programme" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: The research contributes to the healthcare domain by influencing clinical practices and public health policy regarding cervical cancer screening. It directly affects guidelines for screening, colposcopy practices, and referral criteria.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study provides both short-term and long-term impacts by addressing the immediate effects of HPV vaccination on cervical screening and providing data that may shape future screening models (e.g., HPV testing). "Continued monitoring of cervical screening performance in immunised women and the assessment of new models of screening...are essential" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: Short-term impacts include changes to colposcopy referral practices, while long-term impacts involve the evolution of cervical cancer screening methodologies to adapt to an immunised population.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The key stakeholders include healthcare providers, public health policymakers, and medical researchers. "These findings have implications for screening, colposcopy referral criteria, colposcopy practice, and histology reporting" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: Policymakers may adjust national screening guidelines, and healthcare providers will need to adapt clinical practices based on the new predictive values for cytology in vaccinated populations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has a deep impact on cervical cancer screening practices, particularly within the medical and public health sectors. It also has broad implications for global screening programmes. "The performance of cervical cytology as a screening test is adversely affected by immunisation, particularly the ability of low-grade cytology to predict clinically significant disease" (Results, Page 583).
Page Reference: Results, Page 583.
Example: Deep impact is observed in the specificity and sensitivity of cervical cytology, while broad impact includes the potential changes to international screening protocols as vaccination becomes more widespread.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings from this Scottish cohort are highly transferable to other regions where HPV vaccination is prevalent. "The findings...have implications for screening and colposcopy referral criteria" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: The study’s outcomes could be scaled to other national cervical screening programs globally, influencing similar changes in colposcopy referrals and cytology interpretation practices.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study highlights a disruptive shift in how cervical screening is conducted in vaccinated populations, requiring reconsideration of traditional cytological methods. "New models of screening (e.g., HPV testing) more adapted to the immunisation era are essential" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: The research disrupts the established approach to cervical cancer screening by questioning the efficacy of cytology in vaccinated women, potentially shifting towards HPV testing as a primary screening tool.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations around the accuracy of screening in vaccinated women are central to the study, especially in preventing unnecessary colposcopies. "The challenge of managing a higher proportion of referred women who have no (or clinically insignificant) disease" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: Ethical considerations include reducing over-diagnosis and unnecessary procedures, promoting a more sustainable approach to screening in immunised populations.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study’s findings have high implementation potential, as they directly suggest changes to clinical guidelines and screening protocols. "Continued monitoring and the assessment of new models of screening...are essential" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: Healthcare systems can easily implement changes in colposcopy referral guidelines based on the predictive values observed in the study.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: This research integrates immunology, cytopathology, and public health, with global relevance given the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination programs. "The lower incidence of disease in vaccinated women alters the key performance indicators of cervical cytology" (Results, Page 583).
Page Reference: Results, Page 583.
Example: The findings are globally relevant, particularly for countries with established HPV vaccination programs, where similar adjustments to screening and colposcopy protocols may be necessary.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study addresses the adaptability of cervical screening programs in the face of changing epidemiology due to vaccination. "The quality of what is arguably the most successful cancer screening programme to date can be maintained" (Discussion, Page 589).
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 589.
Example: The research promotes resilience in cervical screening programs by recommending adjustments to maintain effectiveness in a vaccinated population.
