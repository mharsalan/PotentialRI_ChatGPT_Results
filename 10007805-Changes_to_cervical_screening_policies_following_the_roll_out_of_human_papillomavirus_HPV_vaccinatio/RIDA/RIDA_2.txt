Here are the detailed research impact dimensions for the attached study, based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study's focus on the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine has implications across multiple domains:

Health Domain: "We have shown that the vaccine-specific types HPV16/18 and the cross-protective types (31/33/45) have almost disappeared in this population, 7 years following the receipt of the vaccine and present evidence of herd protection for all these types." (Introduction, page 5)
Policy Domain: "There may be a time when current cytology or HPV-based cervical screening programmes are no longer cost-effective." (Introduction, page 5)
Examples: The research has a significant impact on public health by reducing the prevalence of high-risk HPV types and influencing future cervical screening policies to ensure cost-effectiveness.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study's long-term impact is emphasized by the observation that reductions in HPV prevalence persist many years after vaccination:

"Levels of cross-protective immunity endure for at least 7 years and further follow-up will provide important information as to their ultimate longevity." (Discussion, page 14)
"We are committed to ongoing surveillance to assess the impact of the change to quadrivalent vaccine." (Discussion, page 13)
Examples: The research will have a long-term impact on healthcare by influencing future vaccine choices and screening practices based on sustained HPV immunity​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research benefits several stakeholders:

Healthcare Providers: "The findings should inform the evaluation of screening programs in vaccinated populations with high levels of uptake." (Implications, page 5)
Policymakers: "Our findings should be incorporated in baseline assumptions of such evaluative models for vaccine cost-effectiveness." (Discussion, page 14)
Examples: Policymakers will use this research to shape future HPV immunization programs, while healthcare providers benefit from improved screening strategies​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has both deep and broad impacts:

Deep Impact: The significant reduction in HPV prevalence directly advances cervical cancer prevention (Discussion, page 14).
Broad Impact: The study influences vaccine policy, screening intervals, and public health strategies across multiple health systems (Introduction, page 5).
Examples: This research deeply impacts cervical cancer prevention, while broadly influencing global HPV vaccination and screening policies (Knowledge - Potential R…).

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The results can be scaled and transferred across different healthcare systems:

"Our findings should inform the evaluation of screening programs in vaccinated populations with high levels of uptake." (Introduction, page 5)
The research findings are relevant for other countries with similar high-uptake vaccination programs, highlighting the transferability of the results.
Examples: This research can be scaled to inform national and international cervical cancer screening guidelines and be transferred to other populations with similar vaccination programs​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study offers innovation in HPV vaccination strategies:

"The levels of vaccine effectiveness observed, in particular for the cross-protective types, may have implications for future vaccine choice." (Discussion, page 14)
"There may be a time when current cytology or HPV-based cervical screening programs are no longer cost-effective." (Discussion, page 14)
Examples: The findings disrupt traditional cervical screening methods by suggesting the adoption of HPV-based screening protocols that could extend intervals and potentially reduce costs (Knowledge - Potential R…).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations of equitable vaccine uptake are addressed:

"There remains a deprivation effect in HPV positivity, driven by inequitable vaccine uptake in the catch-up cohorts." (Discussion, page 13)
Examples: The study highlights the importance of equitable vaccine distribution, contributing to sustainable public health strategies that address health disparities .

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research provides actionable insights:

"Our findings should inform the evaluation of screening programs in vaccinated populations." (Implications, page 5)
Examples: The research has immediate usability in refining cervical cancer screening strategies based on vaccination status .

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study's global relevance is apparent as it contributes to international discussions on HPV vaccination and cancer prevention:

"Our findings should be incorporated into models which can inform optimal strategies for future cervical disease screening." (Discussion, page 14)
Examples: The study impacts global health policy and cervical cancer prevention strategies across multiple countries .

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study emphasizes adaptability in screening practices:

"There may be a time when current cytology or HPV-based cervical screening programs are no longer cost-effective." (Discussion, page 14)
Examples: The findings promote adaptable cervical screening strategies in response to changing HPV prevalence due to widespread vaccination​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .

This detailed analysis aligns with the top dimensions of research impact, providing a clear understanding of how the study influences various domains.
