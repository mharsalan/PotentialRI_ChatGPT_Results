Based on the study's content and aligning with the predefined Research Impact Dimensions, the following are the potential research impacts of the study, organized by types of impacts:

1. Health and Well-Being Impact​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…):
Direct Impact on Health: The HPV vaccination reduces HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). This has significant implications for reducing cervical cancer cases globally, improving population health outcomes and life expectancy.
Herd Immunity: The study's evidence of herd effects in populations that are not directly vaccinated, such as boys and older women, expands the health benefits to a broader segment of the population.
Long-Term Health Impact: By preventing cervical and other cancers, the research contributes to long-term improvements in public health and reduces the burden on healthcare systems globally.
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit):
Vaccination Policy Support: The study provides strong evidence supporting WHO recommendations for multi-cohort HPV vaccination strategies, influencing national and global public health policies regarding vaccine implementation.
Global Public Health Policy: The research impacts policy decisions by guiding governmental bodies in scaling up vaccination efforts to achieve better health outcomes across different population cohorts.
3. Social and Cultural Impact​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit):
Public Awareness and Behavior Change: The study highlights the importance of vaccination in reducing disease prevalence, which can lead to increased public acceptance and greater uptake of vaccination programs. It has the potential to reduce stigma associated with HPV-related conditions by normalizing vaccination and promoting awareness.
Social Equity: By demonstrating the benefits of vaccination across genders and age groups, the study promotes social inclusivity and equitable health interventions across different population segments.
4. Economic Impact and Return on Investment​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway):
Healthcare Cost Savings: By reducing the incidence of HPV-related diseases such as cervical cancer, the research has the potential to significantly lower healthcare costs associated with treatment, screening, and care.
Economic Benefits of Preventive Health: Widespread vaccination can lead to fewer cancer cases, resulting in fewer sick days, lower healthcare spending, and increased productivity, contributing to broader economic growth and resource efficiency in healthcare systems.
5. Technological Advancement and Commercialization​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway):
Innovation in Vaccine Deployment: The study supports innovations in vaccination schedules and delivery, including multi-cohort vaccination strategies that have proven more effective. These innovations could be commercialized in different health systems and contexts, especially in low- and middle-income countries, providing a technological framework for large-scale vaccine distribution.
6. Educational Impact​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …):
Influence on Public Health Education: The findings could be used to inform educational curricula around vaccines and public health. This would enhance knowledge dissemination within schools, universities, and professional health training programs.
Training for Healthcare Providers: The study’s insights into the efficacy of vaccination could be integrated into healthcare training programs, ensuring that providers are equipped with the knowledge to promote HPV vaccination and prevention strategies effectively.
7. Environmental Impact and Sustainability​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …):
Sustainable Health Interventions: By demonstrating long-term benefits of vaccination, the research contributes to the sustainability of public health programs by reducing the need for ongoing treatments and invasive medical procedures for preventable diseases. The emphasis on preventive health aligns with goals for sustainable healthcare systems.
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit):
Interdisciplinary Integration: The study integrates epidemiology, public health, and healthcare policy, making it relevant across multiple disciplines and industries. It addresses global health challenges, especially the elimination of HPV-related cancers, making it applicable in varied healthcare contexts worldwide.
Global Public Health Application: The study’s findings have broad international relevance, offering insights that are applicable to both high-income and low-income countries, where HPV vaccination programs may face different logistical challenges.
9. Scalability and Transferability​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…):
Scalability: The demonstrated success of multi-cohort HPV vaccination programs shows that these strategies can be scaled up from small trials to national and international levels, particularly in countries with low vaccination coverage.
Transferability: The research can be adapted and transferred to other vaccine-preventable diseases, making it relevant to a broader spectrum of public health initiatives beyond HPV, such as influenza or COVID-19 vaccination programs.
10. Innovation and Disruption Potential​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…):
Disruption of Traditional Vaccination Approaches: The study challenges traditional, single-cohort vaccination methods by providing evidence for multi-cohort and gender-neutral vaccination strategies, which may disrupt existing public health frameworks and lead to more comprehensive vaccination policies.
Introduction of Gender-Neutral Vaccination: By showing the herd effects in boys and older populations, the research supports a shift towards gender-neutral vaccination policies, disrupting the earlier focus solely on female populations.
11. Ethical and Legal Considerations​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …):
Ethical Implications of Equitable Access: The study emphasizes the need for equitable access to vaccines, which has ethical implications in ensuring that marginalized and underserved populations benefit from preventive healthcare measures. The findings could support legal frameworks promoting universal vaccine access.
These impacts demonstrate how the study contributes to multiple sectors, including health, policy, economics, social equity, and innovation, aligning with the key research impact dimensions of depth, breadth, scalability, and cross-disciplinary relevance.
