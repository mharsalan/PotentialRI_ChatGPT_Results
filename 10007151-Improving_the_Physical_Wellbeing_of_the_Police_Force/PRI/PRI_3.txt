The study "Auditing the socio-environmental determinants of motivation towards physical activity or sedentariness in work-aged adults: a qualitative study" offers various potential research impacts based on its findings, aligning with several impact dimensions identified in research literature. Below are the key potential research impacts of this study across various dimensions:

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: This study contributes to academic advancements in health psychology, public health, and behavioral science by exploring how socio-environmental factors influence physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults. The insights can influence further studies and theoretical development in understanding lifestyle behavior change (Results, pages 4-9).
Cross-Disciplinary Influence: The study bridges disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and public health, contributing to cross-disciplinary academic discourse. These findings could be integrated into curricula in health sciences and social sciences, enriching educational content on health behavior​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Health and Well-being Impact
Health Behavior Change: The study’s insights into the motivational factors that promote or hinder physical activity have direct implications for improving public health. Tailoring interventions based on these findings could lead to reductions in sedentary behavior, improving overall community health and reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Public Health Policies: Policymakers can utilize the research to design more effective health promotion policies. By understanding the socio-environmental determinants of physical inactivity, governments can implement targeted interventions that support work-aged adults in leading healthier lifestyles​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Workplace Wellness Programs: Employers and policymakers can collaborate to create workplace policies that foster a more active environment, such as promoting physical activity during breaks or adjusting workspaces to encourage movement​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Social and Cultural Impact
Societal Norms and Behaviors: The research highlights the social drivers of inactivity, which could reshape societal attitudes toward physical activity. By addressing these socio-environmental barriers, the study could foster a cultural shift toward valuing active lifestyles in work-aged adults​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Reducing Sedentariness Stigma: The study could also influence social perceptions by destigmatizing the challenges associated with sedentary behavior, emphasizing a more compassionate approach to addressing lifestyle changes​(impact pathway).
5. Economic Impact
Cost Savings in Healthcare: By encouraging more active lifestyles, the research has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with treating sedentary lifestyle-related conditions. Governments and employers could see a decrease in long-term healthcare expenditures​(Common Research Impact …).
Workplace Productivity: Healthier employees are often more productive, which can lead to economic benefits for employers through reduced absenteeism and increased efficiency​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Behavioral Change
Promotion of Physical Activity: The study provides insights that can be used to encourage behavioral changes in work-aged adults, leading to increased physical activity. This change can result in improved physical and mental health, benefiting individuals and communities​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Implementation and Usability
Usability in Public Health Campaigns: The findings could be implemented in public health campaigns designed to reduce sedentariness. The study’s emphasis on the role of social agents in influencing behavior can be practically applied in community outreach programs and social media campaigns to promote more active lifestyles​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Scalability and Transferability
Global Applicability: The research findings are not limited to one geographic or cultural context. The socio-environmental determinants identified in the study are likely relevant across different cultures and countries, making the research transferable to various populations globally​(impact pathway).
Scalability to Broader Initiatives: The principles identified in the study could be scaled up from local interventions to national or even international health initiatives, such as global health campaigns or programs targeting specific population groups like older adults or those in sedentary occupations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovative Approaches to Health Promotion: By integrating socio-environmental factors into strategies for promoting physical activity, the study challenges traditional methods of health promotion that often focus only on individual behavior change. It introduces a more holistic, context-aware approach to health behavior interventions​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness: The research has the potential to increase public awareness about the socio-environmental factors influencing sedentary lifestyles. Public engagement initiatives based on this study could educate communities about the importance of creating supportive environments for physical activity​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
Targeting Vulnerable Groups: The study identifies socio-environmental factors that disproportionately affect certain demographic groups, including those with limited access to active living environments. By addressing these inequities, the research could lead to more inclusive health interventions that reach underrepresented populations​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Technological Adoption and Innovation
Health Apps and Tools: The findings can be used to develop digital health tools, such as mobile apps that track social and environmental barriers to physical activity, offering tailored advice to individuals based on their specific contexts. These tools could be adopted by healthcare providers to support patients in leading more active lifestyles​(impact pathway).
13. Monitoring and Surveillance
Tracking Sedentary Behavior: The study’s framework could be used to develop systems that monitor physical activity and sedentary behavior in specific populations, providing real-time data that can inform public health strategies and interventions​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
14. Capacity Building and Training
Training Healthcare Providers: The study’s findings can inform the development of training programs for healthcare providers, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to address socio-environmental barriers to physical activity in their patients​(Research Impact Knowled…).
By addressing these various dimensions, the study has the potential to create wide-reaching impacts across health, policy, economic, and social domains.
