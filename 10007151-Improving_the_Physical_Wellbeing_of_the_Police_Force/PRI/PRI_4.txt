Based on a thorough analysis of the study and drawing from the common research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts for the study you provided, aligned with the predefined dimensions:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
The study primarily contributes to health and well-being by exploring "exercise as medicine" programs. The insights gained from the study can improve health outcomes by refining how exercise programs are prescribed and implemented in medical settings. By focusing on the stakeholder dynamics between primary care providers and exercise professionals, the research identifies barriers that, if addressed, could enhance public health outcomes through more effective exercise interventions​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
This study could influence public health policies related to preventive care and exercise prescription. As exercise is increasingly recognized as a crucial component of health management, the findings on how to better coordinate healthcare providers and exercise professionals could shape policies that standardize exercise referrals within primary care, advocating for more integrated approaches to healthcare​(Research impact toolkit).

3. Scalability and Transferability
The research highlights challenges in scaling exercise medicine programs due to local implementation variations. If these challenges are addressed, the research could lead to scalable exercise programs that could be transferred to different healthcare settings and regions, promoting widespread adoption of exercise as a core component of healthcare​(Common Research Impact …).

4. Social and Cultural Impact
By examining the societal and professional dynamics that affect the delivery of exercise programs, the study contributes to understanding how cultural attitudes towards health, responsibility, and wellness influence public health initiatives. This can lead to cultural shifts in how society views exercise not only as a personal responsibility but as a structured and essential part of healthcare​(Research impact toolkit).

5. Economic Impact
The study identifies inefficiencies in the delivery of exercise programs, pointing to potential cost savings if these programs were better structured and aligned with healthcare systems. Reducing healthcare costs through preventive measures, such as exercise, could have a significant economic impact by lowering the burden of chronic diseases on healthcare systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

6. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
By exploring the complexities of integrating exercise into healthcare systems, this study adds to the body of knowledge on preventive medicine and health promotion. It opens avenues for future research on how exercise professionals and healthcare providers can collaborate more effectively, potentially leading to breakthroughs in both health outcomes and program delivery frameworks​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Equity and Inclusivity
The study identifies disparities in how exercise programs are prescribed and accessed, highlighting the need for more equitable healthcare interventions. By addressing these barriers, the research can help develop more inclusive exercise programs that ensure populations with lower access to healthcare services, such as underserved communities, benefit from preventive exercise interventions​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

8. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
The study suggests improvements in how healthcare providers deliver exercise-based interventions, emphasizing the need for clearer communication and role definitions between healthcare providers and exercise professionals. These recommendations can lead to better integration of exercise into clinical practice, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency​(Research Impact Knowled…).

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The study bridges healthcare, social sciences, and policy domains by examining the organizational and personal dynamics influencing exercise program delivery. Its findings have global relevance as exercise prescription becomes increasingly important in preventive healthcare across different cultural and healthcare settings​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

10. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The long-term engagement with exercise programs, as discussed in the study, raises questions of sustainability in healthcare. The ethical implications of how exercise programs are funded and delivered, particularly in under-resourced areas, are critical. Ensuring sustained access and engagement in exercise programs across populations requires addressing these ethical concerns​(Research impact toolkit).

11. Behavioral Change
The study can contribute to societal behavior change by promoting exercise as a medical treatment, potentially shifting public perception from viewing exercise as a lifestyle choice to recognizing it as a healthcare necessity. This could lead to increased public engagement with exercise programs and healthier lifestyle choices​(Common Research Impact …).

12. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The research brings innovative perspectives by challenging traditional views of healthcare delivery, particularly around the role of exercise. By showing that exercise programs need a more structured and collaborative approach between healthcare providers, it could disrupt how preventive healthcare is organized, potentially leading to more integrated healthcare systems​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

13. Public Awareness and Education
The findings of this study could contribute to raising public awareness of the benefits of exercise for health, especially when integrated into healthcare plans. Educational campaigns based on these insights could lead to better public understanding and participation in preventive healthcare practices​(Common Research Impact …).

These potential impacts reflect the broad and deep influence this research could have across healthcare systems, public health policy, and societal views on preventive medicine and exercise.
