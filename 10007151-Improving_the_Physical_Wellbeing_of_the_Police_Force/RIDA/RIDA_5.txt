Based on the document, "We have the time to listen: community Health Trainers, identity work and boundaries," and the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is the dimension-by-dimension analysis for research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The research focuses on how community Health Trainers (HTs) contribute to health improvement in disadvantaged communities by addressing health inequalities and promoting healthier lifestyles (Results, page 598)​(5 (8)).
The study also explores HTs’ identity work and occupational boundaries, adding to sociological discussions on health-related occupations (Introduction, page 598)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 598.
Example: This research impacts multiple domains, particularly health, by addressing public health policies, and sociology, by providing insights into the identities and roles of lay health workers in community settings.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The study contributes long-term insights into occupational identity and the health sector by focusing on HTs, a relatively under-researched area in public health policy. It lays the groundwork for future research on community health work and identity (Results and Discussion, page 602)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 602.
Example: The findings could influence long-term public health initiatives by emphasizing the role of lay health workers in reducing health disparities, which may impact future policy and community health work.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The research benefits several stakeholders: HTs, public health professionals, community groups, and policymakers, by offering insights into how HTs support healthier lifestyles in disadvantaged areas (Introduction, page 597)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 597.
Example: Policymakers and local governments could use these findings to better implement community-based health programs and improve support structures for lay health workers like HTs.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
The study offers deep insight into the occupational identity of HTs and their interactions with other health professionals (Results and Discussion, page 601)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 601.
Example: It deeply impacts public health policy and sociological research by providing detailed insights into the identity work of HTs, but also has broad implications for how health policies incorporate lay health workers in different regions and communities.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
The research emphasizes the flexible, community-centered role of HTs, which can be applied in various contexts and scaled up for broader public health policies (Discussion, page 603)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 603.
Example: The community health model explored here could be scaled up to address health disparities on a national level or transferred to other countries aiming to implement similar public health strategies.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
The role of HTs is described as innovative in public health policy, particularly in their ability to address a wide range of health issues across disadvantaged populations (Introduction, page 597)​(5 (8))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 597.
Example: The HT initiative could disrupt traditional public health strategies by emphasizing the value of lay health workers in reducing health inequalities, potentially influencing how healthcare is delivered to underserved populations.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
The research discusses the sustainability of HTs in promoting long-term health behavior changes in communities, particularly through personalized support that addresses clients’ socio-economic constraints (Discussion, page 604)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 604.
Example: HTs provide sustainable health improvements by fostering ongoing, personalized engagement with clients, ensuring long-term health behavior changes that align with ethical practices in public health.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
HTs offer practical and usable strategies for health promotion, particularly by providing clients with tools and goal-setting advice to improve their health (Results, page 603)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 603.
Example: The implementation of HT services in community settings demonstrates effective, usable methods for promoting health that can be adapted to other local health services globally.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
The research incorporates sociological, public health, and policy perspectives, making it relevant across disciplines (Results, page 600)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 600.
Example: The findings are globally relevant, particularly for regions where health disparities exist, offering insights that can be applied in different sociopolitical contexts to reduce inequalities in health.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
HTs exhibit resilience and adaptability by taking on expanding roles within the community, particularly when other health services are cut or underfunded (Discussion, page 602)​(5 (8)).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 602.
Example: The ability of HTs to adapt to changing health demands and policies makes this model highly resilient, offering lessons for other health systems facing similar economic or resource challenges.
This analysis aligns the study with each of the top 10 dimensions of research impact, illustrating the study's relevance across various academic, social, and policy contexts.
