The study titled "Auditing the socio-environmental determinants of motivation towards physical activity or sedentariness in work-aged adults: a qualitative study" provides valuable insights into how socio-environmental factors influence the physical activity and sedentariness of adults aged 30-60. I will map these findings to the top 10 dimensions of research impact based on the attached documents.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research primarily addresses health behavior by analyzing motivational determinants that encourage or discourage physical activity in work-aged adults. Key socio-environmental factors include family, friends, workmates, healthcare professionals, and cultural norms (Results, pages 4-8).
Page Reference: Results, pages 4-8.
Example: This research contributes to the health domain by identifying key influencers on lifestyle choices, providing insights that could be used to design public health interventions promoting physical activity and reducing sedentariness.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study’s conclusions, particularly about the influence of social agents on long-term lifestyle habits, suggest long-term impacts. By unpacking complex social motivators, the study lays the foundation for future public health interventions that can be applied over extended periods (Discussion, page 15).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 15.
Example: The long-term impact could include shaping ongoing public health campaigns and informing policy changes aimed at reducing inactivity-related health problems.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include healthcare professionals, policymakers, and fitness organizations that can apply the findings to develop intervention strategies. Indirect stakeholders involve work-aged adults and society as a whole, who would benefit from reduced sedentariness (Methods, page 3; Results, pages 12-14).
Page Reference: Methods, page 3; Results, pages 12-14.
Example: Public health officials and NGOs can use the findings to shape programs targeting physical inactivity in midlife adults, benefiting long-term community health.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has a deep impact on the understanding of motivational influences in the field of health psychology. However, its breadth extends to public health, social behavior, and possibly policy design, as it examines various social and environmental influences (Results, pages 9-14).
Page Reference: Results, pages 9-14.
Example: Deep impact in healthcare through specific, actionable insights about social motivators of physical activity. Broader impacts might include policy adjustments or workplace wellness programs.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research can be scaled from small interventions to larger public health initiatives, such as community-based programs promoting physical activity. Its principles could also be transferable to other regions or countries with varying social norms (Results, page 14).
Page Reference: Results, page 14.
Example: A local initiative based on the study's findings could be scaled to a national or global level, helping to combat sedentariness in different demographic contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: By identifying and categorizing socio-environmental motivators, the study introduces a nuanced approach to understanding the dual role of motivators for both activity and sedentariness. This could disrupt traditional methods of promoting physical activity, which often overlook such complexity (Discussion, pages 15-16).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 15-16.
Example: The disruptive potential lies in reshaping intervention strategies to consider socio-environmental motivators' dual influence rather than treating physical inactivity as a simple behavioral issue.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study calls for health professionals to examine the socio-environmental motivations for sedentary behavior, supporting sustainable behavior change. It also addresses ethical concerns by advocating for personalized interventions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach (Discussion, page 16).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 16.
Example: Promoting sustained physical activity through tailored interventions could lead to long-term health improvements without imposing restrictive measures that fail to consider individual circumstances.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings suggest that health professionals and policymakers need to incorporate a broader understanding of socio-environmental influences into practical interventions (Discussion, page 16).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 16.
Example: Practical implementation could include workplace policies that support physical activity by addressing logistical barriers or social influences on inactivity.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: This research has relevance across multiple disciplines, including public health, psychology, sociology, and policy-making. Its exploration of socio-environmental motivators offers insights that could be applied globally to combat inactivity in diverse populations (Discussion, pages 16-17).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 16-17.
Example: The study’s findings could be integrated into global health policies aimed at addressing physical inactivity, a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research highlights how motivational influences are context-dependent, suggesting that interventions need to be adaptable to different social and environmental contexts (Discussion, pages 17-18).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 17-18.
Example: Future interventions can adapt to different cultural norms or changing work-life structures by using the flexible framework provided in this study to promote active lifestyles.
This analysis reflects the study’s contribution across these 10 key dimensions of research impact.
