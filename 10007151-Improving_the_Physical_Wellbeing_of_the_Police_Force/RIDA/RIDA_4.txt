Here is the detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions for the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study examines the role of "exercise as medicine" programs, focusing on stakeholder dynamics and how perceptions of value and responsibility affect program delivery and impact. The research spans multiple domains:

Health Domain: "The provision or prescription of 'exercise as medicine' is often depicted as being linear and predictable" (Results, page 520).
Social Domain: The study investigates how "partnerships fluctuate according to balances between organizational and personal objectives" (Results, page 507), addressing societal structures in program delivery.
Page Reference: Results, page 507, 520.

Example: The research impacts the health domain by exploring the complexities of health promotion through exercise programs. It influences the social domain by identifying how societal structures and professional roles interact, affecting service delivery.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study identifies both short-term and long-term impacts, such as the immediate challenges faced in "engendering population-level health changes" and the difficulty in standardizing delivery mechanisms (Results, page 520).

Page Reference: Results, page 520.

Example: The short-term impact is the immediate scrutiny on how exercise programs fail to deliver expected health outcomes. The long-term impact could influence future exercise medicine frameworks and policy adaptations to better address program scalability and efficacy.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders identified include strategic managers, Exercise Professionals, and Primary Care Health Providers (PCHPs), whose perceptions of responsibility and program value shape service delivery (Discussion, page 519). The study highlights how differing perspectives among these groups create unintended consequences in program efficacy.

Page Reference: Discussion, page 519.

Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare professionals who deliver the exercise programs, while indirect stakeholders are the populations these programs aim to serve by improving health outcomes. The study impacts stakeholders by emphasizing the need for greater alignment in roles and goals.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has deep impact in the health sector, affecting how exercise is prescribed and delivered. It also has a broad influence by questioning the intersection of social, healthcare, and organizational structures (Results, page 507).

Page Reference: Results, page 507.

Example: The deep impact is on the health sector's understanding of exercise as a long-term treatment. The broad impact extends to policy and community health initiatives that rely on integrated approaches to exercise programs.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study highlights challenges in scaling exercise programs to achieve population-wide health improvements due to funding, resource limitations, and local delivery practices (Results, page 520).

Page Reference: Results, page 520.

Example: The research findings could inform scalable solutions by addressing the local-specific barriers that hinder broader implementation. The transferability aspect is seen in how the lessons from this study could apply to other health initiatives requiring localized delivery.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study contributes innovation in understanding the role of exercise as medicine beyond traditional frameworks. It introduces novel insights on how stakeholder dynamics and partnership models shape healthcare delivery (Discussion, page 519).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 519.

Example: The disruption potential lies in redefining how exercise programs are conceptualized—not as a uniform treatment but as a dynamic, stakeholder-driven service that varies across contexts. This could lead to more customized health intervention models.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical challenges are identified in terms of equitable access to exercise programs and how funding allocations affect service provision. The study emphasizes long-term engagement with exercise across the lifespan, raising concerns about program sustainability (Discussion, page 520).

Page Reference: Discussion, page 520.

Example: The research encourages sustainable exercise engagement by highlighting the need for ongoing support structures beyond short-term interventions. Ethical considerations involve ensuring equitable access despite geographic or resource limitations.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: There is a clear focus on the usability of exercise programs, with findings suggesting that current delivery methods are inconsistent and that there is a need for clearer program goals and feedback mechanisms (Results, page 518).

Page Reference: Results, page 518.

Example: The study informs future program designs to ensure usability across diverse healthcare settings. By highlighting gaps in feedback, the research paves the way for more user-centered program implementations.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study crosses health, social sciences, and policy domains by examining the interplay between organizational, personal, and societal factors in program delivery (Results, page 507).

Page Reference: Results, page 507.

Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance in both healthcare and social science domains. It could inform global health policy on exercise prescription and community health initiatives.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study shows resilience by adapting to local program challenges, such as funding constraints, and flexibility in responding to heterogeneous health needs (Results, page 520).

Page Reference: Results, page 520.

Example: The resilience of the study is seen in its identification of ways to adapt exercise programs to meet both individual and population health goals. Adaptability is key in overcoming program barriers like funding and resource limitations.

These impact dimensions align with the broader goals of enhancing health outcomes through exercise while addressing the social, policy, and operational complexities of program delivery​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
