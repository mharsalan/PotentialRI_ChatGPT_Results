
Based on my reading of the study and aligning it with predefined research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of the study, "Reconsidering Research and Supervision as Creative Embodied Practice: Reflections from the Field" by Bacon and Midgelow:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge: The study introduces new frameworks for movement-based research in doctoral processes, offering innovative approaches to artistic research and supervision. This enhances academic understanding in creative research methodologies, especially in dance and performance.
Example: Academic programs in creative arts may adopt these new methodologies for supervising practice-based doctoral research, influencing future generations of researchers.
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Cultural Sector Enhancement: By improving supervisory practices and supporting artists in conducting and making their research public, the study bridges the gap between academia and the cultural sector. This fosters a more supportive environment for artists to explore their practice and share their work with a broader audience.
Example: Cultural organizations can implement the study’s approaches to support artists in residency programs, thereby enriching the creative process and making it more visible and valuable to the public.
Collective and Networked Research Approaches: The emphasis on co-relational and collective research processes can encourage more collaborative and community-focused research environments in both academia and the arts. This shift can promote broader social engagement with creative research.
Example: Institutions might adopt these practices to foster collective creative projects that engage local communities, artists, and academics.
3. Educational and Training Impact
Improvement in Doctoral Supervision: The study’s innovative supervision practices could transform how doctoral candidates in the arts are guided through their research, providing them with a more holistic, embodied approach to research supervision.
Example: Universities can integrate these supervision practices into their doctoral programs, resulting in more engaged and reflective doctoral candidates who are better equipped to handle the complexities of practice-based research.
Capacity Building in the Arts: By providing tasks, provocations, and activities for both supervisors and candidates, the study strengthens the skills and capacities of those involved in creative arts research.
Example: Institutions may use these frameworks in workshops and training sessions to better equip supervisors and candidates with the tools to navigate practice-based research.
4. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Disrupting Traditional Research Models: The study challenges conventional academic research methodologies by positioning embodied practice and creative reflection as central components of the research process, rather than as supplementary.
Example: This approach could disrupt the way research is traditionally assessed in the arts, with more emphasis on process and embodied knowledge rather than just outputs or final works.
5. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Transferability to Other Disciplines: While focused on dance and performance, the study’s principles of creative supervision and embodied research practices could be applied to other creative fields, such as visual arts, music, and even design.

Example: Other creative disciplines could adopt these supervision methods, allowing for cross-disciplinary dialogue and a broader application of embodied research approaches.
Global Application: The study’s models for supervision and creative research are relevant to academic and cultural institutions worldwide, offering flexible frameworks that can be adapted to different cultural contexts.

Example: Institutions in various cultural settings can implement these approaches, particularly in countries with strong traditions of performance and practice-based research.
6. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influence on Arts Education Policy: By highlighting the need for more structured, reflective approaches to supervising creative research, the study could influence educational policy at institutions that offer practice-based PhD programs.
Example: National arts councils and educational ministries could adopt some of the study's frameworks to improve the quality and consistency of doctoral supervision in creative arts programs.
7. Ethical and Social Considerations
Revised Ethical Frameworks for Practice-based Research: The study rethinks ethical procedures in creative research, proposing more nuanced approaches that account for the complexities of embodied and practice-based research.
Example: This could lead to changes in how ethics committees approach practice-based research, ensuring that ethical guidelines are more aligned with the specific needs of creative researchers.
8. Public Awareness and Engagement
Raising Awareness of Artistic Research: By making artistic research processes more transparent and accessible to the public, the study can enhance public understanding of creative research and its societal value.
Example: Cultural events, exhibitions, and public lectures based on the study’s frameworks could help raise public awareness and appreciation of the research process in the arts.
9. Behavioral Change
Change in Supervisory Practices: The study could influence a shift in how supervisors approach practice-based doctoral research, promoting more empathetic and creative supervision methods that prioritize the needs of the researcher as an artist.
Example: Supervisors may adopt more reflective and creative feedback processes, changing the dynamics of supervisor-candidate relationships in practice-based research programs.
10. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application of Supervisory Models: The study provides actionable tasks and activities that supervisors and candidates can implement immediately, making its approaches highly usable in real-world academic and creative contexts.
Example: Institutions can integrate these activities into their research frameworks, creating more engaging and supportive research environments for creative doctoral candidates.
11. Long-term Impact and Legacy
Sustainable Research Practices: By emphasizing the importance of reflection and embodiment in creative research, the study promotes sustainable, long-term engagement with creative processes that extend beyond the completion of a PhD.
Example: Creative arts researchers may continue to use the reflective practices introduced in this study throughout their careers, ensuring that their research remains relevant and impactful over time.
These dimensions highlight how the study is positioned to make significant contributions not only within academia but also in the broader cultural, educational, and policy landscapes, creating long-term, sustainable impacts across various sectors.
