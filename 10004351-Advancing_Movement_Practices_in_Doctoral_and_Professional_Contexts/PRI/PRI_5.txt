Based on the analysis of the available documents, the research impact pathways for this study can be outlined in several stages, focusing on how the study's findings can achieve impact both before and after publication. This comprehensive pathway will help ensure the research translates into real-world changes, addressing multiple sectors including education, social sciences, and creative arts.

Before Publication: Building Foundations for Impact
Stakeholder Engagement and Co-creation:

Involve relevant stakeholders early: Key stakeholders include educators, doctoral students, research supervisors, and creative arts practitioners. Early engagement ensures that the research outcomes are informed by the needs and challenges faced by these groups.
Workshops and Focus Groups: Organize workshops and focus groups with supervisors and students to test the study’s concepts, such as the Creative Articulations Process (CAP). These interactive sessions help refine the study based on real-world experiences.
Preliminary Knowledge Sharing:

Conferences and Academic Presentations: Share early findings at academic conferences such as those focusing on artistic research or educational methodologies. This establishes credibility and invites constructive feedback, making the findings more robust.
Public Engagement through Creative Platforms: Present the research at public exhibitions or events in the creative arts community. By demonstrating practical applications, it can reach a wider, non-academic audience.
Pilot Programs in Educational Settings: Test the CAP model through pilot implementations in selected universities. These pilots will allow for data collection on how the model functions in real-time supervisory and research settings.
Open Access and Preprints:

Pre-publication dissemination: Share preprint versions of the research through open-access platforms or academic networks. This can generate interest and early adoption, particularly among educators and creative professionals.
White Papers and Practical Guides: Create practical guides or white papers for supervisors and institutions, outlining the application of the CAP model. This will help in early adoption even before the formal publication of the research.
After Publication: Scaling and Sustaining Impact
Formal Academic Dissemination:

Publish in High-impact Journals: Ensure that the research is published in relevant academic journals focusing on educational methodologies, artistic research, and practice-based doctoral programs. This helps disseminate findings across multiple academic domains.
Open Access Strategy: Maximize reach by opting for open-access publication where possible. This ensures that the research is accessible not only to academic institutions but also to creative practitioners and educators worldwide.
Training and Capacity Building:

Workshops for Supervisors and Educators: Conduct structured training workshops for doctoral supervisors and educators, focusing on the practical application of the CAP model. These workshops will help integrate the research findings into ongoing educational programs.
Online Courses and E-learning Modules: Develop e-learning courses that explain the CAP model and its application in creative research. This will help scale the impact to a global audience, allowing educators and students worldwide to benefit from the research.
Integration into Doctoral Curricula:

Curriculum Development: Collaborate with universities to integrate the CAP model into the curriculum of doctoral programs in the arts. This ensures that the research findings are institutionalized and adopted as part of standard educational practices.
Creating Educational Materials: Provide educational materials such as guides, handbooks, and templates that help supervisors and students implement the CAP model effectively.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Expand Beyond Arts: Promote the transferability of the CAP model to other creative disciplines, such as visual arts, theater, and music. This will help the research reach a broader audience and enhance its cross-disciplinary impact.
Global Collaborations: Form international partnerships with universities and arts organizations to promote the CAP model globally. This can involve collaborative research projects and cross-institutional programs, further extending the research’s impact.
Long-term Monitoring and Feedback:

Ongoing Feedback Mechanisms: Develop mechanisms to gather feedback from educators, students, and institutions using the CAP model. This feedback can be used to continuously refine the model, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.
Annual Symposia and Conferences: Organize annual symposia where educators and practitioners can share their experiences with the CAP model. This fosters a community of practice and ensures the model’s continued evolution.
Technological Integration:

Develop Digital Tools: Collaborate with developers to create digital tools or apps that integrate the CAP model into supervisory practices. These tools could include journaling features, reflective practice templates, and visual mapping tools, making the model more accessible in both academic and professional settings.
Integrate into Learning Management Systems: Work with educational institutions to incorporate the CAP model into existing LMS platforms, such as Moodle or Canvas, ensuring that it becomes part of the standard toolkit for creative research supervision.
Key Outcomes and Broader Impacts
Policy Influence:

By demonstrating the effectiveness of the CAP model in enhancing doctoral supervision and creative research methodologies, this research can influence educational policy at institutional and national levels, encouraging more support for practice-based PhD programs.
Social and Cultural Impact:

The research has the potential to reshape how creative practices are understood and articulated within both academic and professional communities. By promoting reflexivity and embodied practice, it contributes to new ways of thinking about knowledge creation in the arts.
Equity and Inclusivity:

By offering a model that embraces diverse, embodied, and reflexive research practices, this research supports inclusivity in educational settings, ensuring that a wide range of artistic voices and practices are represented in academic research.
In conclusion, the research impact pathways for this study are comprehensive and multi-dimensional. By carefully planning pre-publication engagement, effective dissemination strategies, and post-publication scalability and adoption, this study has the potential to significantly influence both academic and creative arts communities, enhancing doctoral research practices and supporting long-term cultural and educational change.
