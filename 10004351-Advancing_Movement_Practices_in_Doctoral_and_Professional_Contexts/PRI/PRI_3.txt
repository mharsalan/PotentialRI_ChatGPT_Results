nsights provided from the uploaded study on the Creative Articulations Process (CAP) by Jane M. Bacon and Vida L. Midgelow, I will outline the potential research impacts and the research impact pathways as per the available guidelines on research impact dimensions.

Potential Research Impacts of the CAP Study:
Academic Domain Impact:

Expansion of Knowledge: The CAP study contributes to the academic field by exploring new methods of understanding and articulating creative processes in dance. This model encourages reflective practices within artistic research, impacting fields such as choreography, creative arts, and practice-based research.
Interdisciplinary Influence: CAP’s emphasis on embodied cognition and tacit knowledge can extend its influence into psychology, philosophy of mind, and even education, enriching discussions around creativity and embodied learning.
Development of New Methodologies: By providing a structured model with six phases (Opening, Situating, Delving, Raising, Anatomizing, and Outwarding), the CAP offers a novel approach to the articulation of dance and other embodied practices. This model can inspire further academic research, fostering new lines of inquiry in performance studies and other creative disciplines.
Cultural and Social Domain Impact:

Empowerment of Practitioners: The CAP model promotes self-reflection and articulation among dance practitioners, empowering them to better understand and communicate their creative processes. This may lead to a broader cultural shift within artistic communities, fostering a culture of reflection and deeper engagement with embodied practices.
Influence on Artistic Practices: CAP’s structured approach to exploring creative processes has the potential to shape how artists and dancers approach their work, leading to innovations in the creation and performance of dance, as well as other forms of embodied art. The model’s use could influence contemporary art forms, enriching the wider cultural landscape.
Educational Domain Impact:

Improvement of Dance Education: By providing a framework for students and educators to explore and articulate their creative processes, CAP could enhance curricula in dance and performance education, making the process of learning more reflective and integrated.
Pedagogical Innovation: CAP’s structured phases offer a model that can be incorporated into educational programs, facilitating deeper engagement with creative practice. This may lead to changes in how creative practices are taught, focusing more on process-oriented, reflective methodologies.
Professional Development:

Capacity Building: The CAP model helps artists and researchers develop skills in articulating their creative processes, which can be crucial for securing funding, collaborating with others, and building professional portfolios. This could enhance the capacity of artists to engage in practice-based research and advocate for their work.
Mentorship and Guidance: By providing a framework for reflection and development, CAP can serve as a mentorship tool for experienced practitioners to guide emerging artists, enhancing professional growth and knowledge sharing within the arts community.
Innovation and Disruption:

Innovative Articulation of Tacit Knowledge: CAP addresses a gap in the articulation of tacit, embodied knowledge in the arts, offering a method for bringing unspoken or ineffable aspects of creative work into language. This innovation can disrupt traditional methods of artistic evaluation and critique, paving the way for new ways of discussing and assessing creative work.
Global and Cross-Disciplinary Impact:

Global Relevance: The model’s application is not limited to dance but can be adapted to various forms of artistic and creative practices across cultures and disciplines. Its broad applicability makes it a valuable tool in global arts education and practice.
Cross-disciplinary Integration: CAP’s focus on reflective practice can resonate with fields beyond the arts, such as education, cognitive science, and psychotherapy, where embodied cognition and reflective learning are important. This transferability allows for the model to impact a wide range of disciplines.
Research Impact Pathways:
Before Publication (Pre-Impact):

Workshops and Collaborations: Prior to formal publication, CAP can be shared through workshops and creative labs, where artists and educators can engage directly with the process. These interactions foster productive exchanges and could generate immediate, tangible changes in artistic practice, long before formal academic recognition.
Knowledge Transfer through Mentorship: CAP can serve as a foundation for mentorship programs, allowing seasoned professionals to guide younger artists in articulating their processes. Such informal interactions are crucial for embedding CAP into the practice of new generations of artists, extending its impact through professional networks.
Engagement with Artistic Communities: The model can be introduced to various artistic communities, helping to shape discussions about process and reflection within dance and performance networks. By engaging with artistic collectives and cultural institutions, CAP could start influencing practice-based research and discussions.
After Publication (Post-Impact):

Academic Dissemination: Following formal publication in journals such as Choreographic Practices, CAP will be integrated into academic courses, conferences, and research projects. This dissemination can lead to its adoption in curricula and academic programs focused on practice-based research.
Cultural and Social Engagement: CAP can be adapted for use in various cultural settings, including performance workshops, residencies, and public art engagements. These activities will extend its impact beyond academia, influencing public discussions on the role of creative practice in society.
Policy and Funding Advocacy: CAP’s framework for articulating artistic practice can also influence how artistic research is presented in funding applications, helping to align creative projects with funding bodies that emphasize reflective, practice-based approaches. It could contribute to policy discussions on how creative work is evaluated and supported.
Long-term Sustainability:

Embedding CAP into Artistic Institutions: Over time, CAP could become embedded in artistic institutions as a standard model for reflective practice, influencing how artists develop and communicate their work. This could lead to more sustainable practices where artists are regularly engaged in reflective cycles that enhance their creative output and professional growth.
Training and Professional Development: CAP can be integrated into professional development programs for artists and educators, ensuring its longevity as a tool for enhancing creative processes across generations. Such programs will help to establish CAP as a vital tool in the ongoing evolution of artistic practice.
These pathways, when properly supported, will ensure that the Creative Articulations Process continues to generate academic, cultural, and professional impacts across multiple domains​​​​​​.
