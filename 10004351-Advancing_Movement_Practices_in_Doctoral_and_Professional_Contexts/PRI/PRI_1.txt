To detail the Research Impact Pathways for the study titled "Resolving Agency Issues in Client-Contractor Relationships to Deliver Project Success", we must break down the steps and strategies required to achieve the identified impacts before and after publication. This ensures that the research is implemented in real-world settings, making a meaningful contribution to both academic and practical domains. The key pathways include:

Before Publication: Establishing Credibility and Relevance
Stakeholder Engagement and Co-Creation:

Engage with Industry Stakeholders: From the initial stages, involve project managers, contractors, and clients from relevant sectors (e.g., construction, healthcare). This will ensure that the research framework, such as the CURED framework, addresses practical challenges.
Workshops and Focus Groups: Conduct workshops with professionals to gather input on common agency-related risks in their industries and refine the framework to reflect real-world complexities.
Advisory Boards: Set up an advisory board consisting of industry veterans who can validate the practicality of the framework before it is finalized.
Pilot Testing the CURED Framework:

Real-world Application: Apply the CURED framework to live projects (e.g., in construction or clinical trials) to collect data on its effectiveness in managing client-contractor relationships.
Data Collection: Capture both quantitative and qualitative data from pilot projects to assess the frameworkâ€™s impact on project success, relational risks, and contract compliance.
Iterative Improvement: Use the results from pilot tests to fine-tune the framework, ensuring it is adaptable and scalable to various types of projects and sectors.
Early Academic and Industry Dissemination:

Conference Presentations: Share preliminary findings at academic conferences, such as those focused on project management and organizational behavior. This will build academic credibility and prompt peer review.
Industry Forums: Present the framework at industry-specific events, such as construction forums and healthcare project management workshops, to foster early adoption and feedback.
Developing Case Studies and White Papers:

White Papers: Publish white papers for industry professionals, detailing how the framework can mitigate relational risks and improve project outcomes. This will enhance visibility in non-academic circles.
Case Studies: Develop case studies based on the pilot applications, which can demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the CURED framework to potential adopters in the industry.
After Publication: Driving Adoption and Long-term Impact
Strategic Dissemination and Awareness:

Targeted Journals: Publish the final study in high-impact academic journals such as the International Journal of Project Management or Journal of Construction Engineering and Management. This ensures that the research reaches both academic researchers and industry professionals.
Open-Access Platforms: Ensure some publications are open-access, making the research available to a wider audience, including smaller companies or non-academic stakeholders.
Industry Publications: Disseminate findings through industry-specific journals like Outsourcing Pharma and Construction Today to reach decision-makers directly involved in managing client-contractor relationships.
Capacity Building and Training:

Workshops and Webinars: Organize training sessions and webinars for project managers, contractors, and clients on applying the CURED framework. These could be in-person workshops or online modules.
E-Learning Programs: Collaborate with educational platforms like edX or Coursera to develop online courses on relational risk management in project management, integrating the CURED framework as a core module.
Professional Certifications: Partner with certification bodies like the Project Management Institute (PMI) to incorporate the framework into professional development certifications (e.g., PMP).
Policy Influence and Standards Integration:

Policy Briefs: Create policy briefs targeted at government bodies and regulatory authorities responsible for overseeing large public projects or clinical trials. Advocate for the integration of relational risk management principles into official guidelines.
Standardization: Work with standards organizations like ISO or PMI to integrate relational risk management strategies into project management standards. This will institutionalize the framework within global project management best practices.
Technological Integration:

Project Management Software: Collaborate with project management software developers to integrate the CURED framework into tools like Microsoft Project or Primavera. This would allow project managers to track relational risks in real-time, using digital dashboards or reporting tools.
Consultancy Services: Develop consultancy services to help organizations implement the CURED framework in complex projects. These services could include audits, training, and ongoing support for relational risk management.
Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:

Post-Implementation Surveys: After the framework is adopted, set up mechanisms to collect feedback from users on its effectiveness. This could include surveys, interviews, or focus groups with project managers and contractors.
Data-Driven Improvements: Use the collected feedback to continuously improve and update the framework. This ensures its adaptability to emerging project management challenges.
Sustained Global Impact and Cross-Sector Transferability
International Expansion:

Cross-border Projects: Advocate for the use of the CURED framework in large-scale international infrastructure or research projects. Its principles can be adapted to manage relational risks in multinational, multi-stakeholder environments.
Global Collaborations: Partner with international organizations such as the World Bank or OECD to promote the adoption of relational risk management strategies in globally funded projects.
Cross-Sector Applications:

Transfer to Other Sectors: Although designed for construction and clinical research, the framework can be adapted for use in sectors like IT, logistics, and manufacturing, where complex client-contractor relationships are common.
Sector-Specific Customization: Customize the framework for different industries, such as developing industry-specific modules or guidelines that address unique relational risks in each sector.
Public and Educational Outreach:

Integration into Curricula: Work with universities and business schools to incorporate the CURED framework into MBA programs and project management courses. This ensures that the next generation of project managers is equipped with the tools to manage relational risks.
Public Engagement Campaigns: Conduct public seminars and workshops to raise awareness about the importance of relational risk management, particularly in public sector projects that directly affect communities.
Summary of Key Pathways
Pre-publication: Engage stakeholders early, pilot test the framework, and disseminate preliminary findings at academic and industry conferences to build interest and credibility.
Post-publication: Focus on widespread dissemination through academic journals and industry channels, provide training and certification programs, advocate for policy integration, and ensure technological adoption through project management tools.
Long-term: Monitor and refine the framework, promote global adoption, and support ongoing research and education to sustain its relevance and impact over time.
By following these detailed research impact pathways, the study can create significant academic, social, and economic impacts, transforming how client-contractor relationships are managed across various sectors and regions.
