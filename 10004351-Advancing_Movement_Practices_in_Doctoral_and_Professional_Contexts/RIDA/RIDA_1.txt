mpact Dimensions analysis for the attached study, I will focus on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as outlined in the provided document:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Academic Domain: The study primarily contributes to advancing knowledge in project management, particularly in improving client-contractor relationships through the CURED framework, which can influence further academic discourse on relational risks in projects.
Social Domain: By addressing relational risks, the research has the potential to impact how client-contractor relationships are managed across industries, leading to better societal outcomes, such as project success and community benefit.
Economic Domain: By reducing project risks and failures, the framework can lead to economic efficiencies, cost savings, and better project delivery, influencing economic policies in sectors like construction and healthcare.
Policy Domain: The study can influence policies around contract governance and project management in large-scale public infrastructure projects, clinical trials, and government contracting processes.
Example: The CURED framework might become a standard reference for managing relational risks, influencing both industry practices and academic research.

2. Duration of Research Impact:
Short-term Impact: Immediate impacts could involve project managers adopting the CURED framework to manage ongoing client-contractor relationships more effectively.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the framework may influence the development of new project management methodologies and relational risk management strategies, becoming part of the standard toolkit for complex projects.
Example: The framework's long-term impact might include shaping industry standards or becoming integrated into project management certifications like PMIâ€™s PMP.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Direct Stakeholders: Project managers, contractors, and clients in industries reliant on external contracts (e.g., construction, pharmaceuticals, government).
Indirect Stakeholders: Society at large, which benefits from successful project delivery (e.g., infrastructure, healthcare, environmental projects).
Example: Contractors and project teams who apply the CURED framework in projects can reduce relational breakdowns, leading to fewer project delays and cost overruns.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Deep Impact: The framework could fundamentally change the way client-contractor relationships are managed, offering a new methodology for addressing relational risks.
Broad Impact: The principles of the framework could be applied across various sectors, such as IT, healthcare, and manufacturing, broadening its applicability beyond construction.
Example: A construction company that implements the framework may significantly reduce project failures, while the same framework could be adapted to manage relationships in large-scale clinical trials.

5. Scalability and Transferability:
Scalability: The framework can be scaled from individual projects to entire industries or sectors, influencing how relational risks are managed on a large scale.
Transferability: Although developed for construction and clinical trials, the framework can be adapted for use in other industries with complex client-contractor dynamics, such as IT outsourcing.
Example: A national infrastructure project management office might scale the use of the framework to all projects, improving overall project outcomes.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Innovation: The CURED framework introduces new ways of thinking about relational risk management, incorporating both agency theory and practical applications for project managers.
Disruption: The framework could disrupt traditional contract management practices by shifting the focus from purely financial or legal terms to relational dynamics.
Example: The introduction of relational risk management into project governance could replace or enhance traditional contract models, leading to fewer disputes and project failures.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Sustainability: By promoting better project governance and reducing relational breakdowns, the framework can contribute to the long-term sustainability of projects, ensuring that resources are used efficiently.
Ethical Considerations: The framework encourages ethical behavior in client-contractor relationships by emphasizing trust and collaboration over purely transactional interactions.
Example: A more collaborative, ethically sound approach to project management might prevent exploitation of contractors and lead to more equitable project outcomes.

8. Implementation and Usability:
Implementation: The CURED framework is designed to be easy to implement for project managers, with clear guidelines on managing relational risks and building trust between clients and contractors.
Usability: It is user-friendly for both experienced project managers and newcomers, offering practical steps to improve collaboration.
Example: A project manager in a government contracting agency could quickly adopt the framework to address relational risks in large public works projects.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Cross-disciplinary: The research crosses multiple disciplines, including project management, behavioral psychology, and law, making it relevant for various academic and professional fields.
Global Relevance: Relational risks in client-contractor relationships are a universal issue, making the framework relevant for global projects in diverse industries and regions.
Example: The framework could be adopted in international development projects, where client-contractor dynamics are crucial for successful project delivery.

10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Resilience: The CURED framework is designed to be adaptable to different project environments, allowing project managers to adjust their relational risk strategies as conditions change.
Adaptability: Its principles can be applied across different industries and geographic locations, ensuring that it remains relevant as project dynamics evolve.
Example: A project team working on a cross-border infrastructure project could adapt the framework to handle the complex relational dynamics involved in managing international contractors.

This detailed mapping provides insight into how the study impacts various domains, with scalable and transferable applications across multiple sectors and global relevance in managing client-contractor relationships.
