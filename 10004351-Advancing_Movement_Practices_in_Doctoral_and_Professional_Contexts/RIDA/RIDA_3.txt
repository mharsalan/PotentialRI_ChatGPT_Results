Based on the file provided and aligning with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact from the Knowledge document, I will now analyze the Research Impact Dimensions for the study outlined. Below is the detailed breakdown of the potential research impact dimensions for the study titled "Creative Articulations Process (CAP)":

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study contributes to several key domains:

Academic Domain: The CAP model is deeply rooted in practice as research and artistic inquiry, which primarily impacts academia by contributing new knowledge and methodologies to the fields of choreography, embodied cognition, and somatics. It offers frameworks that can be employed across various disciplines to explore creative practices and artistic research.

Excerpt: "The article establishes the foundations of the process, briefly introducing the work of Hincks, Gendlin, and Damasio" (Introduction, p. 1).
Example: This research enriches academic discourse on creative processes in dance, influencing performance studies, and potentially being adopted in other forms of artistic research, contributing to interdisciplinary knowledge.
Social and Cultural Domain: The research informs artistic practices, fostering deeper social and cultural understanding through embodied experiences in performance and creative expression.

Example: Artists and cultural practitioners can use the CAP model to reflect and articulate their creative processes, which may, in turn, affect cultural production, arts education, and public engagement with the arts.
2. Duration of Research Impact
The research has both short-term and long-term impacts:

Short-term Impact: Provides immediate tools and frameworks for artists and researchers to enhance their reflective practice.
Excerpt: "CAP seeks to draw upon and retain what might be described as tacit knowledge" (p. 2).
Example: The CAP model may be quickly adopted by dance practitioners, helping them articulate their practices better within weeks of engagement.
Long-term Impact: The integration of CAP into educational curricula and artistic practice is likely to influence how artists reflect on and articulate their work for many years, forming the basis for future research in practice-based fields.
Example: This model could influence future frameworks in artistic research, shaping the long-term development of artistic inquiry in higher education.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
The study directly and indirectly affects a range of stakeholders:

Direct Stakeholders: These include artists, choreographers, and academic researchers engaged in creative practices.
Excerpt: "The model engenders an attitude of curiosity and openness to aid a process-oriented reflection" (p. 3).
Example: Choreographers and performance artists will directly benefit from applying the CAP model to gain new insights into their creative processes.
Indirect Stakeholders: Educational institutions, artistic communities, and cultural policy makers who support creative industries also benefit indirectly by enhancing the reflective capacities of artists and promoting the value of artistic practice in broader cultural contexts.
Example: Universities and arts programs may adopt the CAP framework to improve curriculum design, fostering more reflective and articulate artistic practitioners.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
The study offers both deep and broad impact:

Deep Impact: Within the field of choreography and dance studies, the CAP framework allows for a profound shift in how artists perceive and articulate their creative processes.
Example: The CAP model deeply influences how artists reflect on their work, particularly in performance contexts, encouraging new approaches to embodied cognition and articulation.
Broad Impact: CAP’s principles can be transferred to other creative fields such as theatre, visual arts, and performing arts. Its application in broader artistic fields can enhance reflective practices across multiple creative disciplines.
Example: Visual artists or musicians may use CAP to explore and articulate their practice, potentially applying it to community arts programs or even in therapy settings.
5. Scalability and Transferability
The CAP model shows potential for both scalability and transferability:

Scalability: CAP can be scaled from individual artistic practice to collaborative projects or even national arts education programs.
Example: CAP could be scaled up for use in university MFA programs, or applied in national-level arts education initiatives to teach creative reflection.
Transferability: The process is highly transferable to other creative disciplines beyond dance, including theatre, visual arts, and creative writing, encouraging cross-disciplinary application.
Example: Writers or sculptors may adopt CAP to articulate tacit knowledge in their creative processes, expanding its use across different creative industries.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The CAP model introduces innovative methods of reflective practice, though it is more innovative than disruptive:

Innovation: The CAP framework innovates by providing new methods for tacit knowledge articulation and reflective artistic practices.
Excerpt: "In particular, during 2005–2008, we worked to develop particular strategies for bringing dance- and movement-based performance into language" (p. 3).
Example: CAP’s approach of combining somatic markers and reflective articulation is an innovative method that has the potential to enhance the creative process across multiple domains.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The study aligns with ethical and sustainable artistic practices:

Sustainability: CAP encourages sustainable creative practices by promoting self-reflection and mindfulness, which can lead to more sustained and thoughtful artistic development.

Example: Artists who engage with CAP may develop more sustainable creative processes by consistently reflecting on their practices, reducing burnout, and encouraging personal growth.
Ethical Considerations: The model supports ethical artistic exploration, allowing practitioners to navigate their creative processes without external pressures.

Example: CAP encourages non-judgmental exploration, creating ethical spaces for artists to develop their work free from societal or institutional constraints.
8. Implementation and Usability
The CAP model is highly usable for both individual practitioners and institutions:

Usability: Artists can easily integrate CAP into their reflective practice, while educators and mentors can employ it as part of their teaching methodologies.
Example: CAP could be used as part of structured reflection in creative workshops or incorporated into performance review processes in dance companies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The CAP model's focus on tacit knowledge and creative articulation gives it broad cross-disciplinary relevance:

Global Relevance: CAP can be applied in different cultural and geographic contexts where creative practice is studied or performed, making it relevant on a global scale.
Example: Artistic practices in Asia, Europe, or Africa could adopt CAP to enhance the articulation of indigenous or local creative traditions.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study shows strong resilience and adaptability due to its flexible framework:

Resilience: CAP can be adapted to suit various stages of the creative process, making it resilient to different artistic needs and challenges.
Example: Artists experiencing creative blocks can use CAP to unlock new ideas and find inspiration, highlighting its adaptability in creative exploration.
By analyzing these dimensions, it is clear that the CAP model has the potential to significantly influence academic research, artistic practice, and educational frameworks, making it a valuable contribution across multiple domains and ensuring sustained, long-term impact.
