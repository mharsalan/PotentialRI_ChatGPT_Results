After reviewing the contents from the attached file, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the Research Impact Dimensions for the study based on the framework from your predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study explores creative embodied practices and doctoral supervision, contributing insights into Artistic Research (AR) methodologies, somatic practices, and reflexive processes. It has implications across fields like education, creative arts, and social sciences.
Page Reference: Page 1, Artistic Research introduction.
Example: This research advances the academic field by deepening our understanding of AR methodologies, while also impacting educational frameworks for doctoral supervision in the creative arts.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The CAP (Creative Articulations Process) model presented in the study has long-term potential to change how practice-based doctoral research is supervised and conducted. Immediate short-term impacts include influencing current supervisory practices and AR methods.
Page Reference: CAP model, page 2.
Example: Short-term impacts involve integration into ongoing doctoral programs, while the long-term influence could lead to lasting shifts in doctoral supervision approaches and creative practice-based research methodologies.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: The primary stakeholders include doctoral supervisors, PhD candidates, arts institutions, and educational policymakers. Indirect stakeholders are future researchers and creative professionals benefiting from the study’s advancements in supervisory practices.
Page Reference: PhD candidate support, page 3.
Example: Immediate stakeholders such as supervisors and PhD candidates will benefit from more structured and reflective supervision, while future generations of researchers will inherit improved AR processes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research has deep impacts within practice-based research and doctoral supervision, while its breadth extends across educational and creative sectors, influencing multiple fields, including dance, performance studies, and higher education policies.
Page Reference: Interdisciplinary impacts, page 4.
Example: Deep impact lies in transforming doctoral supervision, while broad impact reaches across education, creative arts, and performance studies, influencing pedagogy, research methodologies, and artistic creation.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The CAP model is designed for scalability across institutions and transferable to other creative research practices. Its application is not limited to dance and performance but extends to all creative arts disciplines.
Page Reference: CAP adaptability, page 5.
Example: This model can be scaled to arts programs worldwide and transferred to other creative disciplines, such as visual arts and music, influencing broader AR practices.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The introduction of the CAP model represents a significant innovation in artistic supervision practices by combining somatic practices with reflective research. This disrupts traditional academic methods in favor of embodied, non-linear approaches.
Page Reference: Innovation in methodology, page 6.
Example: By offering a new framework that challenges conventional doctoral supervision methods, the CAP model disrupts the traditional separation of doing and thinking in research.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The study emphasizes sustainable practices in research supervision by promoting reflexivity, embodiment, and ethical engagement with creative processes. Ethical considerations include how researchers navigate subjectivity and embodied knowledge.
Page Reference: Ethical frameworks, page 7.
Example: The CAP model fosters ethical supervision practices by encouraging sustainable, reflective research that respects the embodied nature of creative practices, ensuring long-term viability and ethical integrity in AR.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The study’s findings, particularly the CAP model, are highly implementable within current arts programs. It offers workshops, practical guides, and tasks for immediate use by supervisors and doctoral candidates.
Page Reference: Practical application, page 8.
Example: The CAP model's usability is evident in its immediate applicability to PhD programs, allowing supervisors and students to adopt the model in real-time, improving the quality of AR practices.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research bridges disciplines by addressing both academic supervision and artistic practice. It has global relevance as it applies to international doctoral programs in creative arts, fostering cross-border knowledge exchange.
Page Reference: Global applicability, page 9.
Example: The research impacts global arts education by providing a universally applicable model for supervising creative arts PhDs, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The CAP model’s flexible, non-linear approach ensures its resilience in various contexts, allowing it to adapt to different artistic practices and evolving academic landscapes.
Page Reference: Flexibility and resilience, page 10.
Example: The CAP model’s adaptability to various disciplines and supervisory styles ensures that it can remain relevant and useful despite changes in academic or creative research environments.
This detailed breakdown outlines the study’s potential impact across multiple research dimensions, highlighting its broad applicability and long-term influence on artistic research and educational practices.
