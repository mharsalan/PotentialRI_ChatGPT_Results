Based on the document you provided, here are the Research Impact Dimensions in detail for the attached study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
This dimension relates to the different areas or sectors where the research exerts influence.

Academic Domain: The study’s investigation into improvisation as a way of thinking and embodiment has significant implications for dance studies and phenomenology, advancing academic discourse in performance arts and philosophy.

Example: The study could impact curricula in dance and performing arts education, influencing how educators incorporate embodied practices into teaching. (Academic Domain)
Social Domain: By exploring how somatically based dance practices affect both dancer and viewer, the research could influence public engagement with performance art, leading to broader societal appreciation for embodied practices.

Example: Community-based dance workshops could use these insights to promote mental health and social well-being through movement.
Health Domain: The emphasis on somatic practices and bodily awareness can be transferred to therapeutic settings for treating physical and mental health conditions, enhancing rehabilitation and wellness.

Example: Health practitioners might integrate somatic movement into physical therapy to aid recovery from injury, emphasizing mindfulness and body awareness.
Cultural Domain: The research contributes to the preservation and development of contemporary dance practices, particularly somatic-based improvisation, influencing cultural heritage and performance art.

Example: Institutions promoting cultural heritage could incorporate somatic dance practices to highlight how these forms embody cultural expressions.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
This dimension assesses the time frame over which the research exerts its influence.

Short-term Impact: The immediate impact includes enriching discussions on dance education and somatic movement, with potential incorporation into academic curricula.

Example: The study might prompt short-term changes in how dance schools teach improvisation, leading to new teaching methodologies.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the study may influence how phenomenology and performance studies are intertwined in both academic and therapeutic settings, potentially influencing fields like cognitive science.

Example: The concept of “thinking through the body” could become foundational in the development of interdisciplinary fields linking dance with psychology and cognitive sciences.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
The dimension focuses on identifying who benefits from the research.

Direct Stakeholders:

Dancers and Performers: They will benefit from a deeper understanding of embodied knowledge, using the research to refine their practices and enhance performance.
Educators: Teachers of dance and movement will adopt the findings to design more embodied pedagogies, particularly in arts education.
Indirect Stakeholders:

Public Audiences: As audiences engage with performances informed by this research, their perception of embodied movement and the role of the body in thought will deepen.
Healthcare Providers: The therapeutic application of somatic practices could benefit physical therapists, psychologists, and wellness coaches.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
This dimension captures the intensity and reach of the research contribution.

Deep Impact: The research provides a profound transformation in understanding the role of improvisation as a mode of thinking, impacting how professionals in dance view their practice.
Example: Dancers could fundamentally change their creative processes by focusing on somatic experiences and internal perceptions rather than external choreography.
Broad Impact: The cross-disciplinary relevance of the study means its influence could extend to fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, and therapy, enhancing practices beyond the arts.
Example: Scholars in cognitive psychology might use this research to explore how movement influences cognitive processes.
5. Scalability and Transferability
This dimension assesses whether the research can be applied on a larger scale or transferred to new contexts.

Scalability: The research can be scaled within dance education and therapeutic programs globally, adapting the somatic principles to various cultural and educational contexts.

Example: The CURED framework for body-mind integration could be implemented across global dance institutions or adopted as part of wellness programs in diverse sectors.
Transferability: The findings are highly transferable, particularly into therapy and cognitive sciences, where body awareness and movement are integral to healing and learning processes.

Example: Psychotherapists might incorporate the study’s findings on embodied cognition into therapeutic practices for trauma patients.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
This dimension focuses on how the research introduces innovative methods and disrupts traditional approaches.

Innovation: The study redefines how improvisation is understood, positioning it as a way of thinking through the body, which can revolutionize performance theory and somatic education.

Example: Dance schools might adopt a more philosophical approach to teaching movement, focusing on bodily perception as a primary tool for creative thinking.
Disruption: By positioning dance improvisation as a mode of knowing and thinking, the research disrupts traditional views of cognitive processes as separate from physical experiences.

Example: This could lead to a paradigm shift in how educators and performers understand the role of the body in artistic expression and intellectual engagement.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
This dimension evaluates the sustainability and ethical alignment of the research.

Sustainability: The research encourages sustainable practices in mental and physical health, emphasizing the integration of body-mind approaches that do not rely on invasive or harmful treatments.

Example: Somatic practices inspired by the research can be integrated into community health programs, promoting long-term mental and physical well-being.
Ethical Considerations: The emphasis on body autonomy and the ethical handling of personal bodily experiences makes the research particularly relevant in fields like therapy, ensuring participants engage in safe and respectful ways.

Example: Health practitioners could use these principles to guide ethical practices in movement therapy, ensuring clients maintain control over their experiences.
8. Implementation and Usability
This dimension looks at how research can be practically implemented.

The research findings are highly usable in both academic and therapeutic settings. Teachers, dancers, and health professionals can easily apply these insights into classrooms, studios, and therapy rooms.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research has relevance across various disciplines and global regions.

Cross-disciplinary: The principles of somatic practice can be adapted by other fields, such as psychology, cognitive science, and even philosophy, as these domains explore the connections between movement and thinking.

Example: Cognitive scientists could integrate somatic awareness into studies of perception and consciousness.
Global Relevance: The universal nature of body-mind practices ensures that the research can be adapted and applied across cultural contexts, promoting body awareness in education and health sectors globally.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
The dimension assesses the flexibility and adaptability of the research in changing contexts.

The framework of somatic improvisation is highly adaptable to different cultural practices and social settings, ensuring its resilience in diverse educational and professional environments.
These detailed research dimensions highlight the broad and deep impact the study has on various sectors, from education and the arts to health and science.
