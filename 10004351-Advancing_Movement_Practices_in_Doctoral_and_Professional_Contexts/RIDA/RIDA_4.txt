Example: Workshops and training sessions for supervisors may be directly influenced by the study, leading to more structured approaches in mentoring candidates in creative fields.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the frameworks introduced could redefine how arts-based doctoral programs are structured, creating lasting changes in how creative research is conducted and articulated.
Example: Future academic programs in arts and performance may adopt these practices as core components, influencing curricula and educational structures for years to come.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Direct Stakeholders: Doctoral candidates, supervisors, and academic institutions involved in creative and practice-based research.
Example: Supervisors will benefit from adopting new approaches to supporting creative arts research, while doctoral candidates will experience more structured guidance throughout their research journeys.
Indirect Stakeholders: The broader creative arts community, including practitioners outside academia, cultural organizations, and funding bodies.
Example: Cultural organizations may adopt these reflective practices in their residencies and collaborations, promoting a deeper understanding of creative processes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Deep Impact: The study offers significant contributions to practice-based research methodologies, potentially reshaping the approach taken in the supervision and conduct of creative arts research at the doctoral level.
Example: It provides a robust framework for creative researchers to articulate and reflect on their processes, which could lead to new theoretical advancements in performance studies.
Broad Impact: Beyond the immediate academic sphere, the study's approaches could influence other creative industries, where reflective and structured articulation of creative processes is valuable.
Example: Practitioners in fields like visual arts, creative writing, and even design might adopt similar frameworks to enhance their own research and reflective practices.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Scalability: The study’s frameworks can be scaled to apply across various creative disciplines and educational institutions globally.
Example: From small art academies to large universities, the CAP (Creative Articulations Process) model can be adapted to different scales of artistic and academic inquiry.
Transferability: While rooted in dance and performance, the methodologies can be transferred to other forms of creative research, including visual arts, theater, and music.
Example: Institutions specializing in different art forms can integrate these reflective processes into their research programs, promoting broader adoption across disciplines.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Innovation: The study introduces innovative approaches to creative research supervision, focusing on the embodied, reflective process rather than solely outcome-driven methodologies.
Example: The CAP model could inspire new forms of creative expression and research articulation, offering alternative pathways for creative researchers to document and reflect on their work.
Disruption: The potential to disrupt traditional methods of research supervision in the arts, which have historically been less structured and articulated, offering a more methodical approach to creative research.
Example: Academic institutions may shift towards more structured, reflective methods of supervision, disrupting conventional, less formal approaches.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Sustainability: By promoting reflective and embodied practices, the study encourages sustainable, ongoing engagement with creative processes, ensuring that creative practices are constantly renewed and refined.
Example: The CAP model fosters long-term personal and professional development for researchers, helping them to sustain their creative inquiries over time.
Ethical Considerations: The study emphasizes ethical practices in supervision, ensuring that creative research is conducted with a focus on the well-being of both the researcher and their practice.
Example: Ethical supervision practices highlighted in the study ensure that the emotional and creative needs of doctoral candidates are met, creating more supportive research environments.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Usability: The frameworks provided are easily implementable within educational and research settings, offering practical tasks, provocations, and activities that can be used by supervisors and candidates alike.
Example: Supervisors in creative arts doctoral programs can immediately integrate these practices into their mentorship, using the tasks and activities outlined to guide their candidates through the research process.
Implementation: The CAP model is designed to be adopted by creative research programs across different institutions, making it practical for widespread use in various academic and professional settings.
Example: Creative arts departments can implement these methods in their curriculum, offering structured reflective practices as part of their research training for students.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Cross-disciplinary: Although primarily focused on dance and performance, the study’s reflective models are applicable to any form of creative research, making it highly relevant to a variety of fields.
Example: Visual artists, musicians, and writers could use the CAP framework to articulate their creative processes, fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration.
Global Relevance: The model is applicable across different cultural contexts, making it relevant for creative researchers globally.
Example: Institutions in diverse cultural settings can adapt the CAP model to support their own forms of creative practice and research, making it globally impactful.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Resilience: The study’s methodologies are likely to remain relevant for future generations of creative researchers as they continue to evolve and adapt their research practices.
Example: As new forms of artistic research emerge, the CAP model can be adapted to incorporate these developments, ensuring its ongoing relevance.
Adaptability: The flexible nature of the CAP model allows it to be adapted to different forms of research and creative practice, ensuring that it remains useful even as the landscape of creative research evolves.
Example: As new technologies and artistic practices develop, the reflective processes of the CAP model can be adapted to integrate these innovations.
These impact dimensions ensure that the study not only advances academic knowledge but also fosters broad and lasting contributions to the global creative community, shaping how creative research is conducted, supervised, and articulated across disciplines and regions.
