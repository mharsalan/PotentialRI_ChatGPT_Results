Here is the detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the attached study titled "Concussed or Not? An Assessment of Concussion Experience and Knowledge Within Elite and Semiprofessional Rugby Union," as per the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The primary aim was to assess experience and knowledge of adult concussion among international, professional, and semiprofessional players, coaches, medical staff, and referees within Rugby Union." (Introduction, p. 1) "Several role-specific misconceptions and deficiencies in concussion knowledge were identified and should be targeted through education." (Conclusion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction (p. 1), Conclusion (p. 5)
Example: This research has a broad impact across multiple domains, particularly in health (improving concussion management protocols), education (informing targeted concussion education programs), and policy (informing governing bodies like World Rugby on necessary educational reforms). The results can influence player welfare and safety protocols.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The study’s findings, particularly in identifying knowledge gaps, provide foundational data for improving concussion education in rugby, which may result in long-term improvements in player safety and health outcomes." (Discussion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Discussion (p. 5)
Example: This study will likely have long-term impacts by shaping concussion protocols and educational programs for the Rugby Union, with future research building on its findings to improve concussion management in sports. Short-term impacts might include immediate adjustments to how teams manage head injuries during matches.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Players, coaches, medical staff, and referees are the key player welfare stakeholders in rugby, and their concussion knowledge is vital to improve concussion management." (Introduction, p. 1)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction (p. 1)
Example: Direct stakeholders include medical staff (who can implement improved concussion protocols), coaches, and players (who benefit from enhanced safety measures). Indirect stakeholders could be governing bodies like World Rugby and public health authorities, who can use this data to inform national policies on head injuries in sports.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The results suggest that medical staff should play a greater role in educating players and coaches about concussion management." (Conclusion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion (p. 5)
Example: The depth of the study's impact is seen in its role in enhancing medical education about concussion management within the Rugby Union. The breadth of impact extends across sports and public health, informing concussion protocols in other contact sports and raising awareness of concussion risks more broadly.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The study’s findings can be used to improve concussion education not only in Rugby Union but also in other sports with similar risks of head injury." (Discussion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Discussion (p. 5)
Example: This research has scalability potential as its findings could be applied in international rugby leagues or even scaled to sports like American football and soccer. Its transferability lies in the ability to adapt the educational frameworks across different sports and contexts with a high risk of concussion.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The findings highlight a need for more innovative approaches to concussion education, potentially disrupting current practices by involving medical staff more directly in player education." (Conclusion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion (p. 5)
Example: The research introduces innovative strategies for concussion education, encouraging direct involvement from medical staff rather than relying solely on traditional educational methods. This could disrupt current practices in player welfare management by shifting more responsibility to healthcare professionals.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The study addresses the ethical concern of player safety and the need for accurate knowledge dissemination to prevent long-term brain injuries." (Conclusion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion (p. 5)
Example: The research promotes sustainable health practices by advocating for better concussion management, which ensures players' long-term health and safety. It also aligns with ethical considerations in sports medicine, emphasizing the prevention of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) through proper concussion protocols.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The study identifies practical routes for disseminating concussion knowledge, such as medical staff-led education and the use of online platforms." (Results, p. 4)
Page Reference and Section: Results (p. 4)
Example: The findings are highly implementable within rugby teams, as they propose practical methods for concussion education, leveraging medical staff as the primary educators. The results are also usable for policy-making and medical training in sports organizations.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The research findings can be applied across multiple sports and have implications for global sports governance and public health strategies." (Discussion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Discussion (p. 5)
Example: The study has global relevance and could be adapted across other contact sports, impacting public health policies on a global scale. It also bridges sports science, medicine, and education, making it relevant to multiple disciplines.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The study's recommendations are adaptable to different levels of rugby and can be modified as new concussion research emerges." (Conclusion, p. 5)
Page Reference and Section: Conclusion (p. 5)
Example: The recommendations are adaptable across different levels of rugby, from semiprofessional to elite, ensuring that as knowledge of concussions evolves, the protocols can be updated to reflect new research and evidence-based practices.
These dimensions illustrate the multifaceted impact of the research on improving concussion management within Rugby Union and beyond.
