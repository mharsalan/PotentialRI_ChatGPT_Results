"The study investigates concussion injury rates, the likelihood of sustaining concussion relative to the number of rugby union matches, and the risk of subsequent injury following concussion" (Results, p. 3).

Domains:

Health Domain: The study directly impacts the health domain by providing insights into concussion risks and their effects on professional rugby players' health. The study contributes to understanding injury prevention and return-to-play protocols.
Policy Domain: It informs sports policy, particularly for rugby governing bodies, by contributing to evidence that may shape safety regulations for managing concussions and preventing subsequent injuries.
Example: The research could influence policy changes in rugby leagues and international rugby associations regarding mandatory recovery periods and stricter concussion protocols to protect player health.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
"Concussion incidence increased over the four seasons, while severity remained unchanged" (Results, p. 2).

Categories:

Short-term Impact: Provides immediate insights into concussion incidence and subsequent injury risks, influencing sports medicine practices and return-to-play protocols.
Long-term Impact: Long-term impact on policy development for concussion management in sports, potentially influencing broader safety standards across contact sports.
Example: The research can shape future policies for concussion management in sports over the coming years, influencing how concussions are handled and how players are rehabilitated long-term.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
"Concussion incidence increased, while severity remained unchanged during the 4 years of this study" (Discussion, p. 5).

Stakeholders:

Direct Stakeholders: Rugby players, coaches, team medical staff, sports physicians who are directly responsible for player health and safety.
Indirect Stakeholders: Policy makers in sports organizations, player unions advocating for safer playing conditions, and fans concerned with player welfare.
Example: The study could lead to stronger advocacy by player unions for enhanced safety measures and better post-injury care, benefiting players and the wider sports community.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
"Injury risk was 38% greater following concussion compared to after a non-concussive injury" (Results, p. 3).

Categories:

Deep Impact: Profoundly impacts the understanding of player health in professional rugby, focusing specifically on the long-term health consequences of concussions.
Broad Impact: It contributes to a broader understanding of concussion risks across various contact sports, not just rugby.
Example: The research has the potential to influence other high-impact sports like football, ice hockey, and soccer in the development of concussion protocols.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
"The risk of injuries to specific body regions was greater after concussion... affecting head, neck, upper limb, pelvic, and lower limb regions" (Results, p. 3).

Categories:

Scalability: This research can be scaled across various sports and levels, from club rugby to international sports organizations, impacting concussion protocols globally.
Transferability: The findings can be applied across different sports to inform injury prevention strategies and post-concussion protocols.
Example: The research could be adapted for other high-contact sports, allowing international sports federations to implement similar safety measures and post-concussion monitoring systems.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
"World Rugbyâ€™s Head Injury Assessment protocol may have contributed to the rise in concussion reporting" (Discussion, p. 5).

Categories:

Innovation: The study introduces innovative injury tracking systems like the Head Injury Assessment protocol, pushing for improved injury reporting and transparency.
Disruption: This study could disrupt current return-to-play norms by suggesting stricter recovery protocols after concussions.
Example: The research could influence major changes in concussion management protocols in professional sports leagues, leading to the adoption of new technologies and stricter medical oversight.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
"Players had a 38% greater injury risk after a concussive injury, suggesting return-to-play protocols warrant investigation" (Discussion, p. 3).

Categories:

Sustainability: It highlights the need for sustainable long-term injury prevention strategies in rugby, ensuring the health and longevity of players' careers.
Ethical Considerations: Raises ethical questions about the current return-to-play procedures, suggesting that players may be at risk of injury due to inadequate recovery times.
Example: The study could lead to ethical debates about player health and the responsibilities of sports organizations to protect athletes, prompting reforms in how injuries are managed.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
"The study suggests that concussion return-to-play protocols should be reviewed based on the 38% greater injury risk after concussion" (Discussion, p. 5).

Categories:

Implementation: The findings can be readily implemented by rugby teams, league organizations, and health professionals to improve player safety protocols.
Usability: Provides practical guidelines for medical teams to implement stricter post-concussion recovery timelines to mitigate the risk of subsequent injuries.
Example: This research can be easily integrated into sports medical practices by providing clearer timelines and safer guidelines for players recovering from concussions.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
"Concussion incidence is rising throughout the professional game" (Results, p. 5).

Categories:

Cross-disciplinary: The research connects sports science, medical fields, and policy development, contributing to broader discussions about player safety across various disciplines.
Global Relevance: The findings have global implications for professional contact sports, influencing concussion protocols internationally.
Example: This study could lead to the creation of universal standards for concussion management in sports, influencing organizations like the IOC and FIFA.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
"Return-to-play protocols warrant investigation... for better risk mitigation" (Discussion, p. 5).

Categories:

Resilience: The study calls for more adaptable and resilient concussion protocols that can adjust based on new findings.
Adaptability: Offers a framework for ongoing evaluation and updates to injury protocols, ensuring they remain relevant and effective as more data becomes available.
Example: By encouraging continuous updates to concussion protocols, the research fosters a culture of adaptability in sports safety management, ensuring that protocols evolve with new evidence.

This detailed analysis captures how the research aligns with each dimension of research impact, highlighting both the practical and theoretical implications of the study.
