To assess the research impact of the study on "Multi-nutrient fortification of human milk for preterm infants," I have evaluated the document across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Here are the detailed findings:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study aims to assess the impact of fortifying human milk for preterm infants on key outcomes like growth rates and neurodevelopment, with a particular focus on reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and feed intolerance. This research impacts multiple domains:

Health Domain: Impact on infant healthcare, improving survival and quality of life for preterm infants.
Clinical Policy Domain: It could influence guidelines and protocols in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).
Social Domain: Potentially reducing long-term developmental disabilities, affecting families and caregivers. (Page 7, Methods)
Example: The health domain is directly impacted as the research supports clinical practices that can reduce mortality and morbidity in premature infants, improving neonatal care globally.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study suggests long-term benefits in neonatal care, as fortified human milk may improve neurodevelopment and reduce long-term hospital stays (Page 16, Methods). These findings lay the groundwork for future research in neonatal nutrition and development.

Short-term Impact: Direct implementation in neonatal care.
Long-term Impact: Foundation for future policy changes and nutrition guidelines for preterm infants. (Page 16, Results)
Example: The short-term impact includes the immediate adoption of these fortified milk interventions in NICUs, while the long-term impact could influence nutritional guidelines for preterm infants over decades.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research has direct benefits for several stakeholders:

Direct Stakeholders: Neonatal healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers in pediatrics.
Indirect Stakeholders: Families of preterm infants, who benefit from improved health outcomes. (Page 12, Methods and Results)
Example: The primary stakeholders are NICU healthcare professionals and neonatal nutrition researchers. The secondary stakeholders are parents and families of preterm infants, benefiting from improved survival rates and reduced healthcare costs.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study deeply impacts neonatal healthcare by providing specific evidence for the benefits of fortified milk in preterm infant growth and development. It has broad implications across clinical, social, and economic domains, as improved infant outcomes could reduce long-term healthcare costs. (Page 16, Discussion)

Example: In terms of depth, the research specifically alters neonatal nutritional practices. Broadly, it influences global healthcare systems, reducing hospital costs and improving societal health outcomes for preterm infants.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: This intervention is highly scalable, as it can be adapted to different healthcare settings worldwide, including both developed and developing countries. It is transferable to various contexts, given its simple implementation in neonatal units. (Page 16, Discussion)

Example: Fortified breast milk can be scaled up across NICUs worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings, improving outcomes for preterm infants across different healthcare systems.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: While not radically disruptive, this research introduces innovative nutritional practices that refine existing methods. It enhances current neonatal care by optimizing milk fortification, presenting new evidence that could subtly shift clinical nutrition paradigms for preterm infants. (Page 17, Discussion)

Example: The innovation lies in integrating multi-nutrient fortification into standard care for preterm infants, potentially shifting clinical guidelines without drastic disruptions to current practices.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study aligns with ethical considerations by improving the health of vulnerable preterm infants without introducing undue risks. It promotes sustainable healthcare practices by reducing long-term developmental disabilities and healthcare costs. (Page 17, Discussion)

Example: Ethically, the research supports providing the best nutritional care for vulnerable infants, aligning with principles of fairness and health equity in neonatal care.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: This research is highly usable, as the intervention (fortified breast milk) is straightforward to implement in NICUs. Healthcare providers can easily adopt the findings to improve preterm infant outcomes without extensive additional resources. (Page 16, Results)

Example: Neonatal units can immediately integrate fortified breast milk into routine care for preterm infants, improving growth rates with minimal disruption to existing practices.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research has global relevance, addressing a common issue in neonatal care (preterm infant nutrition). It crosses disciplines like nutrition, pediatrics, and public health, offering solutions that can be adapted worldwide. (Page 16, Results)

Example: The findings are relevant across different healthcare systems globally, improving neonatal care in both high-resource and low-resource settings.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study demonstrates adaptability, as the intervention (fortifying human milk) can be modified based on available resources and different healthcare contexts. It offers a resilient approach to improving preterm infant health under various conditions. (Page 17, Discussion)

Example: Even in resource-limited settings, healthcare providers can adapt the fortification strategy to available supplies, ensuring resilient healthcare practices for preterm infants.

This comprehensive impact assessment showcases how the study impacts multiple dimensions of research, from immediate clinical implementation to long-term health policy changes, providing a broad yet deep contribution to neonatal care.
