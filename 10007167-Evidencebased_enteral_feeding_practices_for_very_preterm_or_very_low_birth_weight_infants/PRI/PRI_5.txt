Based on my thorough review of the attached study, "Slow advancement of enteral feed volumes to prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants," and aligning it with research impact dimensions and frameworks, I have identified several potential research impacts. Below, these impacts are organized into relevant categories based on the different types of research impacts:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
Potential Impact: The study informs neonatal care practices regarding the feeding of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. It shows that slow advancement of enteral feeds may not significantly reduce necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) or mortality, challenging a widely held clinical belief. This can lead to improved neonatal health outcomes by optimizing feeding protocols, reducing unnecessary medical interventions, and minimizing the risks of infection associated with prolonged parenteral nutrition​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Stakeholders: Neonatal healthcare providers, hospitals, and families of VLBW infants.
2. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
Potential Impact: The findings may influence clinical guidelines and protocols for feeding VLBW infants. By providing robust evidence on the risks and benefits of slow feed advancement, the study helps neonatal units refine their feeding strategies, potentially improving patient outcomes through evidence-based practices​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Stakeholders: Neonatal care units, healthcare professionals, clinical educators, and policymakers involved in neonatal healthcare.
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Potential Impact: The study can contribute to policy development related to neonatal care standards at regional, national, and international levels. By demonstrating that slow feeding does not significantly reduce the risk of NEC, policymakers could revise guidelines for feeding practices in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) worldwide​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Stakeholders: Health ministries, neonatal health associations, and organizations like WHO and UNICEF.
4. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Potential Impact: The study contributes to the accumulation of scientific knowledge by providing comprehensive evidence from meta-analyses across different regions. It adds to the understanding of NEC in VLBW infants, influencing future research directions in neonatal nutrition and clinical care​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Stakeholders: Researchers in neonatal medicine, nutrition, pediatrics, and related fields.
5. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
Potential Impact: By reducing unnecessary medical interventions such as prolonged parenteral nutrition and related complications, the study can lead to cost savings in neonatal care. Shortened hospital stays and reduced use of expensive treatments will positively impact healthcare budgets​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Stakeholders: Healthcare providers, insurance companies, public health systems, and national health services.
6. Educational Impact
Potential Impact: The study can be integrated into medical education and training programs for neonatologists and nurses. It enhances the curriculum by providing updated evidence on feeding practices, ensuring that new healthcare professionals are equipped with the latest knowledge on VLBW infant care​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Stakeholders: Medical schools, nursing programs, and continuing education for neonatal healthcare professionals.
7. Social and Cultural Impact
Potential Impact: By improving public awareness of neonatal health issues, particularly regarding the care of premature infants, the study has the potential to influence public health campaigns and cultural practices surrounding preterm birth care​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Stakeholders: Parents, caregivers, neonatal advocacy groups, and the general public.
8. Technological Advancement and Commercialization
Potential Impact: While the study itself does not introduce a new technology, its findings could indirectly stimulate the development of new feeding devices or protocols that optimize enteral feeding practices in neonatal care​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Stakeholders: Medical device manufacturers, healthcare technology companies, and neonatal product developers.
9. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Potential Impact: Reducing the reliance on parenteral nutrition (which requires packaging, storage, and disposal of medical supplies) can contribute to environmental sustainability in hospitals by lowering waste and resource consumption​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Stakeholders: Hospitals, environmental health organizations, and healthcare sustainability initiatives.
10. Capacity Building and Training
Potential Impact: The research contributes to capacity building in neonatal healthcare by informing training programs and workshops on feeding practices for VLBW infants, enhancing the skills of healthcare providers​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Stakeholders: Healthcare educators, training institutes, and neonatal health professionals.
11. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Potential Impact: By challenging assumptions about the efficacy of slow feed advancement, the study raises ethical questions about continuing practices that may not provide benefits and could pose risks, prompting ethical reviews of neonatal care protocols​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Stakeholders: Ethics committees, hospital boards, and legal advisors in healthcare.
12. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Potential Impact: The study’s findings are relevant across multiple domains, including pediatrics, nutrition, and clinical care. Its implications extend globally, as it addresses feeding practices in neonatal care units across different countries and healthcare systems​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Stakeholders: Global health organizations, international neonatal care networks, and interdisciplinary researchers.
These impacts demonstrate the potential for this study to contribute meaningfully to neonatal health, clinical practice, policy, education, and other areas. Each dimension highlights the diverse ways research can exert influence beyond academia, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based decision-making in healthcare.
