Based on the analysis of the study “Deep brain stimulation plus best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD SURG trial)” from the attached file, here are the details of the research impact dimensions as requested:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study's primary focus was on evaluating the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) versus best medical therapy (BMT) in improving the quality of life for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, it measured patient-reported outcomes on the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), a key metric in assessing health and well-being in this population (Results, p. 581–591).
Domains Affected:

Health Domain: The research impacts healthcare practices by providing evidence for the efficacy of deep brain stimulation in improving Parkinson’s disease outcomes. This influences medical protocols for treating advanced Parkinson's disease (Discussion, p. 585).
Policy Domain: The study could inform health policy decisions about the use of surgical interventions versus drug treatments in managing Parkinson’s, guiding future resource allocation and treatment recommendations in neurology (Discussion, p. 586).
Example: The study demonstrates that DBS improves quality of life significantly more than medication alone, which may lead to increased adoption of DBS as a preferred treatment method for advanced Parkinson's in clinical guidelines.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study presents both short-term impacts, such as immediate improvements in patient quality of life (measured after 1 year), and long-term impacts, as the trial spans several years to track ongoing effects (Discussion, p. 585–589).
Example:

Short-term Impact: The study shows that after one year, patients who received DBS had a significant improvement in their quality of life compared to those receiving only medical therapy. This can quickly influence clinical decision-making regarding advanced Parkinson's treatments (Results, p. 586).
Long-term Impact: The research contributes to a foundation for future studies that could investigate the durability of DBS effects over many years, potentially shaping future Parkinson's disease research and treatments (Discussion, p. 589).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Direct stakeholders: Neurologists, neurosurgeons, and Parkinson's disease specialists who implement DBS in treatment plans. Patients with advanced Parkinson’s and their families also directly benefit from improved treatment options and quality of life (Discussion, p. 587).
Indirect stakeholders: Healthcare policymakers and insurance providers who might use the evidence to support coverage decisions and treatment guidelines (Discussion, p. 589).
Example: Neurologists and neurosurgeons will use this evidence to justify surgical intervention for patients who are resistant to medication, potentially influencing treatment strategies in hospitals.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study provides deep impact within the field of neurology and Parkinson’s treatment by offering robust evidence supporting DBS over standard drug therapy. It leads to a better understanding of how surgical interventions can improve patients' quality of life (Results, p. 581–589).
The research also has broad impact across healthcare systems by influencing both clinical practice and healthcare policies (Discussion, p. 589).
Example: The depth of impact is seen in its role in advancing the field of neurology through new insights into Parkinson’s disease management. The broad impact extends to healthcare systems globally, as other countries may adopt similar approaches based on these findings.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The procedures and findings from this trial are scalable, as DBS is a widely used intervention in various neurosurgical centers globally (Methods, p. 582–585).
Transferability of findings is possible to other neurological conditions where surgical intervention is being considered (Results, p. 588).
Example: The techniques validated in the study could be scaled to other hospitals or transferred to treatments for conditions like epilepsy or dystonia where neurosurgical intervention might offer similar benefits.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

Innovation: The study introduces deep brain stimulation as a more effective treatment than medication alone for advanced Parkinson's, thus innovating the standard approach to managing the disease (Discussion, p. 586).
Disruption: DBS has the potential to disrupt traditional drug therapy regimens for Parkinson’s by showing superior outcomes, which may lead to a shift in clinical practices (Results, p. 586).
Example: The trial’s evidence supports a potential shift in Parkinson’s disease management away from drug-only treatment towards surgical interventions, disrupting the current reliance on medication.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study highlights that while DBS provides substantial benefits, it is not without risks, including serious surgery-related adverse events. This raises ethical considerations regarding patient selection and informed consent (Results, p. 587–589).
Example: Sustainability in healthcare could be impacted if DBS becomes widely adopted, necessitating long-term follow-up studies to ensure its benefits continue to outweigh the risks over time.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The findings of the study are highly usable in clinical settings, as they provide clear guidance for neurosurgeons and neurologists on the benefits and risks of DBS compared to standard medical therapy (Methods, p. 583).
Example: The research results are directly implementable in treatment protocols for Parkinson’s disease, guiding doctors in making informed choices about surgical interventions.

9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research holds cross-disciplinary relevance, potentially influencing not only neurology but also fields such as neuropsychology and bioethics due to the cognitive impacts of DBS (Results, p. 588).
Example: Globally, neurosurgical centers could adopt similar approaches, making this study relevant across countries with diverse healthcare systems (Results, p. 589).

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The study shows resilience in its methodology by adapting surgical techniques based on the patient’s needs and the surgeon's discretion, ensuring the trial's outcomes are widely applicable (Methods, p. 582–585).
Example: The adaptability of the surgical approaches used in this trial (targeting different brain regions) makes the research applicable across different clinical settings and patient needs.

These dimensions showcase the wide-reaching impact of the PD SURG trial in terms of both immediate clinical practice and long-term contributions to Parkinson's disease management and research.
