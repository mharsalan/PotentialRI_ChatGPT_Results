Based on the detailed structure from the uploaded document, I will now provide an overview of how each of the 10 dimensions of research impact applies to the study. I will follow the structure from the text, offering clear examples and defining characteristics from the study in relation to each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The study affects multiple domains, such as academic, social, economic, environmental, and policy.
For instance, academic impact can be seen in theoretical advancements within specific disciplines. Environmental impact appears in climate-related challenges, and policy impact reflects changes in public policy regarding sustainability practices.
Example:

Research contributing to climate adaptation strategies influences the environmental domain by promoting sustainability, the economic domain by influencing green job creation, and the policy domain by shaping adaptation measures at the government level.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The research has both short-term and long-term impact. In the short-term, it influences immediate actions or changes, such as rapid applications or shifts in public discourse.
Long-term impact is seen in the foundational nature of the research, influencing future studies or forming the basis for sustained technological innovations.
Example:

Research on renewable energy solutions like solar panel technology shows short-term impacts by being quickly commercialized, while long-term impacts appear in policy shifts towards clean energy adoption and global climate agreements.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

Stakeholders include researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, community groups, and future generations.
The research impacts direct stakeholders like policymakers through evidence-based insights that influence regulations and laws, and indirect stakeholders such as the public who benefit from improved environmental policies or technological advancements.
Example:

Research on autonomous vehicles affects industry professionals by enabling tech companies to create innovative products, and policymakers benefit from insights to regulate new technologies like driverless cars.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research demonstrates deep impact within specific fields, significantly advancing academic knowledge or broad impact by influencing multiple domains like public policy, social welfare, or environmental sustainability.
Example:

A study on climate change models deeply impacts environmental science but also has broad implications for economics, public policy, and health sectors due to its far-reaching effects on human society and infrastructure.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The study is scalable to larger populations or broader sectors (e.g., expanding a successful renewable energy initiative from local to global scales).
Transferability allows findings to be applied in entirely new fields or industries, such as a machine learning algorithm initially used in automotive tech being transferred to medical diagnostics.
Example:

Scalability in renewable energy research where small-scale solar power projects could be expanded globally, and transferability seen in AI technology developed for one sector being adapted for healthcare diagnostics.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research introduces innovative methods or technologies, advancing the field, and has the potential to disrupt traditional practices or existing paradigms.
Disruptive impact could replace current methods with something significantly better or more efficient.
Example:

The development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology is a clear example of disruptive research, revolutionizing fields like medicine and agriculture by offering unprecedented precision in genetic modification.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research offers clear, practical solutions, making findings easy to implement and highly usable by governments, companies, or individuals.
A key measure of success is how easily research translates from theoretical concepts into practical applications that address real-world issues.
Example:

A study developing a portable desalination unit for regions with scarce freshwater supplies exemplifies high usabilityâ€”it is easy to implement with minimal training and offers practical environmental and public health benefits.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research integrates multiple fields (e.g., public health, environmental science) and addresses challenges of global significance like climate change or pandemic response.
This dimension measures how research applies across geographic regions and affects global populations.
Example:

A study on oceanic plastic pollution combines marine biology, economics, and policy analysis, addressing a global crisis that affects ecosystems, economies, and human health worldwide.
