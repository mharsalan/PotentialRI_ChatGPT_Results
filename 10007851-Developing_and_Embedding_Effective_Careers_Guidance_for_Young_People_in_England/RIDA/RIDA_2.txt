
To analyze the research paper on STEM career-related learning, I will map its findings onto the top 10 research impact dimensions as outlined:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"Career-related learning is about raising aspiration... preparing for university entry and ensuring as many students as possible remain engaged and interested in STEM subjects." (Page 18, section 4.1)
"Research suggests that STEM career-related learning can enhance students' enjoyment of STEM subjects, raise awareness of career opportunities, and promote positive progression." (Page 25, Section 3.7)
Domains Impacted:

Educational: STEM career-related learning contributes to student engagement and progression in STEM subjects.
Social: The research impacts societal understanding of the need for STEM career encouragement in educational settings, especially with regards to raising aspirations.
Example: This research supports changes in school curricula to enhance STEM career-related learning, affecting student engagement in STEM fields, thus impacting educational policies and social aspirations.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"Where such evidence within schools exists, there are positive indications of the impact of STEM career-related learning on students... that evidence is not being systematically sought." (Page 17, section 2.5)
Example:

Short-term Impact: Immediate application of STEM career activities leads to higher student engagement in STEM subjects.
Long-term Impact: Over time, STEM-focused learning raises awareness, increases career uptake, and leads to sustainable progression in STEM fields among students​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"Career-related learning involves a wide range of people, including STEM subject teachers, careers coordinators, parents, and employers." (Page 27, Section 5.4)
Example: Direct stakeholders are the students and teachers, while indirect stakeholders include employers benefiting from a more skilled workforce in STEM industries​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Career-related learning is not just about raising aspirations, but also about employability skills... employers have repeatedly said graduates lack employability skills." (Page 28, Section 4.2)
Example: The research deeply impacts educational strategies by integrating career-related learning with STEM subjects. Broadly, it influences employability across various STEM fields, benefiting the broader economy​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Schools can scale STEM career-related activities, involving community stakeholders, parents, and local businesses." (Page 27, section 5.3)
Example: The methods for integrating STEM career-related learning can be scaled from individual schools to regional or national education systems, promoting wide-reaching adoption across different education sectors​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"There are schools that have developed innovative approaches to embedding STEM career learning through extracurricular models." (Page 16, section 2.4)
Example: The research encourages innovative approaches in schools, such as extracurricular STEM clubs that introduce disruptive practices for enhancing student engagement​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"STEM career-related learning must be sustainable... involving regular professional development and support for teachers to continue delivering it effectively." (Page 30, Section 4.4)
Example: The research supports sustainability by embedding career-related learning in the curriculum in a way that can endure over time, ensuring future students benefit​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Teachers should be given time and recognition for their efforts in designing and managing STEM career-related activities." (Page 27, Section 5.4)
Example: The findings are directly usable for educational leaders to improve the implementation of STEM-focused activities, thus enhancing school-wide adoption​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Schools in STEM-rich localities can develop stronger employer links, but this is not a pre-requisite for successful STEM career-related learning." (Page 24, Section 3.6)
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance as it ties career learning to STEM subjects across a range of industries, impacting global education strategies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Schools need a strategic approach to STEM career-related learning that can adapt to changing policies and local conditions." (Page 28, Section 4.2)
Example: The flexible implementation of career-related learning enables schools to adapt their strategies to different local contexts, ensuring resilience​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

This detailed mapping shows the study's strong contributions across all dimensions of research impact.
