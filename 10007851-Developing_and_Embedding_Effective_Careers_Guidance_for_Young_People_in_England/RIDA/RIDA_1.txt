
Here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions based on the document you provided, mapped to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact"​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study significantly impacts the Educational Domain by exploring how career development activities in schools can improve graduation rates and long-term success for students (Introduction, page 1). It also engages with the Social Domain, as it promotes practices that enhance students' transitions to college and careers, thereby influencing social mobility and life outcomes.
The Policy Domain is also affected, as the research advocates for reintegrating career development into school curricula to improve educational outcomes (Foreword, page i).
Example:

The research has influenced the educational sector by encouraging schools to integrate career guidance programs into academic curricula, thus better preparing students for both college and work.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study demonstrates short-term impact by offering immediate solutions for schools looking to improve retention and graduation rates through career development activities (Retention, page 10). It also aims for a long-term impact by suggesting systemic changes that would embed career readiness programs in the educational framework for future generations (Conclusions, page 18).
Example:

In the short term, schools may see a boost in graduation rates after implementing the recommended career development strategies. Long term, this could lead to broader educational reforms that support sustainable student success.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Direct stakeholders include educational institutions and policy makers who can use the study to redesign educational programs (Introduction, page 1). Indirect stakeholders include students and their families, as improved career readiness supports higher educational attainment and life success (Results, page 16).
Example:

School administrators and policymakers can use the findings to advocate for career readiness programs, while students benefit indirectly through improved preparation for college and career transitions.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study has deep impact in the education field, specifically in school counseling and career readiness (Career Development, page 5). Its findings influence a broad range of educational stakeholders, including teachers, counselors, and policymakers (Conclusions, page 18).
Example:

The deep impact is reflected in how school curricula may be reshaped to include career guidance as a core component, while the broad impact is seen in how this reshapes students' academic and career trajectories across different sectors.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The research presents scalable solutions by suggesting career development activities that can be integrated into the standard school curriculum across districts and countries (Conclusions, page 18). The concepts also show transferability, as the principles of career development could apply to different educational settings globally (Introduction, page 1).
Example:

Career development programs initially tested in a few schools could be scaled to national or even global levels, benefiting students across diverse educational environments.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The study introduces an innovative approach by combining technologically-supported career guidance with traditional academic programs (Technologically-Supported Career Development, page 7). This could disrupt current educational practices that often overlook career preparation (Foreword, page i).
Example:

By integrating technology into career guidance, schools may revolutionize how students plan their careers, making it a fundamental part of their education from an early age.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The research addresses sustainability by promoting long-term career development practices that support students' lifelong learning and career management (Conclusion, page 18). Ethical considerations arise in ensuring equal access to these programs for all students, regardless of background (Retention, page 10).
Example:

The sustainable impact lies in building lifelong career skills that extend beyond school, while ethical considerations ensure these programs are accessible to underprivileged communities.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research findings suggest practical, implementable strategies for schools, such as starting career guidance early and using technology to support career development (Results, page 12).
Example:

Schools can easily implement the use of e-portfolios and career simulations as recommended, increasing the usability of career programs in the classroom.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The study shows global relevance by comparing career development practices across different countries and suggesting best practices that could be adapted worldwide (Introduction, page 1). It also highlights cross-disciplinary impact by combining educational, social, and technological aspects (Results, page 16).
Example:

The principles of career readiness explored in this research could be adapted for global educational systems, helping students worldwide transition smoothly into the workforce.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research supports adaptability by suggesting that career development programs be integrated flexibly into different educational contexts, thus responding to changing labor market demands (Introduction, page 1).
Example:

As the labor market evolves, career readiness programs based on this research can adapt to prepare students for emerging fields and industries.
