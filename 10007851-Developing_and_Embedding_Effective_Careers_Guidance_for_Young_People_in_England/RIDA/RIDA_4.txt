
Here is the detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The research impacts the educational domain by focusing on improving career and employability learning (CEL) within schools. It addresses leadership roles in schools and teachers' capacity-building for career guidance. Additionally, it has implications for policy development by informing policy improvements for career guidance in the education system.
Example: The study enhances policy frameworks for integrating career and employability learning in schools. By improving teacher training, the research ensures more effective career guidance, potentially influencing national career guidance policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The research offers short-term impacts by immediately improving teacher confidence and competence in delivering career guidance, with a more long-term impact expected through the integration of sustained career strategies in schools. This could lead to long-term reforms in how career and employability skills are incorporated into the education system.
Example: Teachers gain immediate tools for delivering career education, while schools implement long-term career strategies, ensuring future generations benefit from a well-structured career guidance system​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: Direct stakeholders include school leaders, teachers, and students who are immediately affected by the implementation of career education. Indirect stakeholders are policymakers and government education departments, as the research informs national educational strategies and policy improvements.
Example: By improving teacher training and leadership roles, school staff are better equipped to guide students, while policymakers benefit from data that could inform wider education reforms​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research has a deep impact on the educational field, specifically in career education, by transforming how career and employability learning is delivered. It could also have a broad impact across multiple sectors by influencing policy development and teacher training frameworks beyond just the schools involved in the study.
Example: The CEL framework developed can deeply influence career education across schools, while its broader impact could shape teacher professional development and national career guidance policies​(4).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The project has the potential for scalability, as it suggests Teach First should publicly commit to scaling up the Careers and Employability Initiative by seeking broader funding and expanding its reach across more schools. Transferability is evident as the framework for career education could be adopted by other countries with similar educational challenges.
Example: The initiative could scale up from a pilot project to a national program, improving career guidance systems across the country, and potentially being adapted in other educational contexts globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The research is innovative in its approach to integrating career education within the regular school curriculum, enhancing the role of teachers as career leaders. This introduces a new model for career guidance delivery within schools. However, it does not indicate disruption, as it seeks to complement existing educational systems rather than replace them.
Example: This innovative approach transforms how career education is delivered by embedding it into mainstream education, ensuring that all teachers are involved in career guidance, not just career specialists​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research promotes sustainability by developing a framework that can be scaled up and sustained through continuous funding and policy alignment. Ethical considerations include ensuring equal access to career guidance for all students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Example: By engaging with policymakers and broadening the range of funding sources, the program ensures that career guidance is not a temporary solution but a sustained effort across the education system​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research is highly usable, as it suggests clear recommendations for schools, policymakers, and career leaders. It also emphasizes the need for continuous evaluation to ensure the quality of the program as it expands.
Example: The recommendations provided can be easily implemented in schools, with teachers and school leaders directly applying the career guidance framework developed through the research​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: While the study primarily focuses on the educational domain, it crosses into policy and social inclusion, as it addresses broader issues like inequality in career guidance access. Globally, the framework could be relevant in countries looking to improve career education and employability learning.
Example: The framework for career guidance could be adapted to other educational systems worldwide, particularly in regions facing challenges in providing equitable career education​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(4).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The research demonstrates resilience by providing a framework that can adapt as educational policies evolve. Its focus on continuous evaluation ensures that the framework can be modified as necessary to remain relevant to changing educational landscapes.
Example: As educational policies change, the CEL framework can adapt to new priorities and continue to provide effective career guidance in schools​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
These dimensions highlight the broad and sustained impact this research has on education, policy, and broader societal outcomes.
