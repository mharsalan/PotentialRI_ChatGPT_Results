
After reading through the study and relevant research impact frameworks, here are the potential research impacts for the study, organized according to different types of impact:

1. Educational Impact
Capacity Building in Teachers: The study enhances teachers' abilities to deliver effective career and employability learning (CEL). This directly improves teacher competencies in preparing students for the workforce​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Curriculum Development: The research informs the development of a whole-school career education curriculum that can be implemented widely. The new CEL framework can serve as a guide for integrating employability skills into education​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Policy Impact
Informing Career Guidance Policy: By emphasizing the role of leadership in career education, the study provides valuable insights for shaping future educational policies. These insights could influence national policies on how career guidance is integrated into the education system​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Supporting Evidence-Based Policymaking: The findings could be used to develop policies that support career guidance, making it more accessible and effective for students, particularly those from underprivileged backgrounds​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Social Impact
Equity and Inclusivity in Education: The research addresses educational inequality by ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, receive equal access to career education. This promotes inclusivity in the education system​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Long-Term Benefits for Students: By enhancing career education, the study contributes to the long-term success of students in the labor market. Improved employability skills lead to better career opportunities, impacting students' social mobility​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Economic Impact
Workforce Development: The research supports the development of a skilled workforce by equipping students with employability skills. This has broader economic implications, such as increasing the number of job-ready graduates and supporting the needs of the labor market​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Cost-Effective Educational Interventions: The study highlights a cost-effective way to implement career guidance in schools through a whole-school approach, which could lead to financial efficiencies in education systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Psychosocial Benefits for Students: Career guidance improves students' confidence and mental well-being by providing them with clear pathways and goals for their future careers. This can reduce anxiety and uncertainty related to career choices​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Environmental Impact
Indirect Environmental Impact: Though not directly focused on environmental outcomes, the study's emphasis on career guidance could lead to more students pursuing careers in green industries, thus indirectly contributing to environmental sustainability​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Technological Impact
Integration of Digital Tools: The research suggests using technology (e.g., career planning platforms) to enhance career guidance in schools. This adoption of digital tools could modernize the approach to career education​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Cultural and Social Change
Shifting Educational Paradigms: The study promotes a cultural shift in how schools perceive career guidance—not just as a peripheral activity but as a core part of the educational mission, leading to changes in the role of teachers and leaders in delivering CEL​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability of the Career Framework: The research proposes a model that can be scaled to more schools and regions, ensuring that career and employability learning becomes part of the national curriculum. Its framework is transferable to other educational contexts​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Knowledge Dissemination and Accumulation
Research Dissemination: The findings from this study can be shared with other schools, educators, and policymakers, facilitating a wider adoption of the CEL framework across educational systems​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Stakeholder Engagement
Direct Stakeholders: Teachers, school leaders, and students are the direct beneficiaries of this research. Improved career guidance directly affects how students plan for their future, while teachers and leaders benefit from better training and frameworks​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Indirect Stakeholders: Policymakers and educational institutions indirectly benefit from the research, as it informs broader educational reforms and policy developments​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Ethical and Sustainability Considerations
Sustainable Educational Practices: The study advocates for career guidance approaches that are sustainable over time, integrating career education into the daily operations of schools without needing excessive resources​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
By incorporating these dimensions, this study's research impacts are broad, affecting not only education but also policy, social structures, and long-term economic outcomes.
