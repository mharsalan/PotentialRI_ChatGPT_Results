
Based on a thorough review of the provided study and combining insights from various research impact dimensions​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…), here is an organized list of potential research impacts specific to the study:

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Educational Research: The study's exploration of career development programs within schools enhances the academic field by contributing to education theory, particularly in the context of student readiness for higher education and career pathways. This supports further research on integrating career preparation in curricula (Introduction, page 1).
Cross-disciplinary Contributions: The research offers insights that intersect education, psychology, and social work by investigating how structured career guidance impacts student behavior and academic performance. This fosters a multidisciplinary approach to educational interventions.
2. Social Impact
Improvement in Social Mobility: By recommending career guidance programs in schools, the study contributes to social equity, providing underprivileged students with tools for upward mobility through improved educational and career outcomes (Conclusions, page 18).
Behavioral Change: The findings suggest that students exposed to consistent career guidance exhibit more positive academic behaviors and decision-making processes, which can lead to broader societal benefits in reducing dropout rates and unemployment (Results, page 16).
3. Economic Impact
Long-term Economic Growth: As the study advocates for career development programs that lead to higher graduation rates and better job preparedness, this can ultimately improve workforce readiness, leading to greater economic productivity and job creation in the long term (Conclusions, page 18).
Cost Savings for Educational Institutions: Implementing career guidance programs may reduce dropout rates, leading to lower costs associated with student attrition and underperformance.
4. Policy Impact
Influence on Educational Policy: The study's results may inform national and local policymakers about the importance of career guidance in schools, encouraging educational reforms that prioritize career readiness as a key component of the curriculum (Introduction, page 1).
Support for Legislative Changes: The evidence could lead to new education policies that mandate career development programs in schools, contributing to more standardized approaches to student career readiness across educational systems.
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Psychological and Emotional Well-being of Students: The research highlights how career development programs can reduce students' stress and uncertainty about the future, improving their overall well-being and mental health, particularly during critical transition periods from school to work or higher education (Results, page 12).
6. Technological Impact
Innovation in Educational Technologies: The study suggests using technology (e.g., e-portfolios, career simulations) to enhance career guidance, promoting innovation in educational tools that can be scaled and transferred to various learning environments globally (Technologically-Supported Career Development, page 7).
7. Environmental Impact
Indirect Contribution to Sustainability: While not the primary focus, the study's recommendation for integrating technology in career guidance can lead to the development of virtual career services, reducing the need for physical resources (e.g., printed materials, infrastructure) and contributing to a more sustainable educational model.
8. Cultural and Societal Impact
Shifting Societal Attitudes: The study could contribute to a cultural shift in how society views education, emphasizing the importance of career readiness as part of a holistic education system rather than solely focusing on academic achievements.
Addressing Cultural Diversity: By considering diverse student needs, the study highlights the importance of adapting career development programs to various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, fostering inclusivity in education.
9. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The career development strategies recommended in the study can be scaled across different schools, districts, and even countries, as they offer adaptable frameworks for improving student outcomes (Conclusions, page 18).
Transferability: The research findings are transferable across educational systems globally, especially in regions where student preparation for post-school transitions is a significant challenge. The study provides a model that could be adopted in both developed and developing countries.
10. Capacity Building and Training
Professional Development for Educators: The study recommends training school counselors and teachers to deliver effective career guidance, building capacity within the educational workforce to better serve students' future planning needs (Retention, page 10).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
Addressing Educational Inequalities: The study focuses on how targeted career development can particularly benefit marginalized students, helping close the gap in educational outcomes between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds (Results, page 16).
12. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application in Schools: The study provides clear, actionable recommendations for schools to integrate career readiness programs, making it highly usable for immediate implementation in various educational settings (Conclusion, page 18).
13. Public Awareness and Education
Increasing Awareness of Career Guidance Importance: By disseminating findings to educators, policymakers, and the public, the study raises awareness of the crucial role that career development plays in students' long-term success (Results, page 16).
14. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Foundation for Future Research: The study lays the groundwork for future research into the long-term effects of career readiness programs, contributing to ongoing advancements in educational methodologies and policies (Conclusions, page 18).
These impacts highlight how the study not only influences the immediate educational environment but also has far-reaching implications across societal, economic, and policy domains.
