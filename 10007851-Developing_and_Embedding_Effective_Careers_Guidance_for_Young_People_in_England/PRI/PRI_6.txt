
Based on my reading of the study “Careers leadership in practice: a study of 27 careers leaders in English secondary schools” and aligning it with the predefined dimensions of research impact, here are the potential research impacts of the study, organized according to the types of impacts related:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Educational Domain: The study has a direct impact on educational practices by providing a detailed typology of career leadership models in secondary schools. This contributes to the improvement of career education systems, guiding schools to better structure career leadership roles and responsibilities​(Common Research Impact …).
Policy Domain: By addressing the leadership structures in career education, the study informs policymakers in the education sector about effective models of careers leadership, potentially influencing national policies on career guidance​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Social Domain: The study impacts social structures by potentially improving career guidance and support systems in schools, which can influence students' career trajectories and long-term societal outcomes​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The research provides immediate practical models that can be adopted by schools to reorganize their career leadership structures. Schools can quickly apply these findings to improve their career guidance programs​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-term Impact: The models presented in the study have the potential to shape the future of career education leadership. Over time, the impact could extend to reforms in educational leadership training and career guidance frameworks across various regions and possibly internationally​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
School leaders and educators who are responsible for career guidance within schools.
Policy-makers involved in shaping national or regional educational policies related to career guidance.
Indirect Stakeholders:
Students who benefit from improved career guidance.
Parents and the wider community, as enhanced career education can lead to better career outcomes for students, affecting community development​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study provides a profound understanding of career leadership in schools, offering a well-researched and detailed framework that can deeply influence educational leadership practices. This depth of impact is evident in the typology of leadership models the research offers​(Common Research Impact …).
Broad Impact: Although the study is specific to secondary schools in England, its insights into leadership structures are transferable to other educational contexts, potentially influencing career guidance practices in schools globally​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The models of careers leadership can be scaled to a national or even international level. Schools across the UK, or similar educational systems worldwide, could adopt the study’s findings to improve career guidance programs​(Common Research Impact …).
Transferability: The leadership models identified in the study can be applied to other sectors of education beyond secondary schools, such as vocational training institutions or higher education, enhancing career support across different educational levels​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces innovative career leadership structures that challenge traditional approaches to career guidance. By proposing distributed leadership models and integrating external careers leaders, the research brings new ideas that could modernize career education​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Disruption: The research has the potential to disrupt current hierarchical leadership models in education by promoting more decentralized, flexible approaches to career leadership​(impact pathway).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The research promotes sustainable practices in career leadership by offering models that can adapt to the evolving needs of schools and students over time. These models ensure that career education remains effective and responsive to future demands​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Ethical Considerations: The study emphasizes the importance of fair and equitable access to career guidance for all students, which aligns with ethical standards in education​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study’s findings are practical and readily applicable in real-world settings, offering clear and actionable models for school administrators and policymakers to implement improved career leadership structures​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
Usability: The typology of career leadership models provides a user-friendly framework that schools can adopt and customize to their specific contexts​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study’s implications extend beyond education to areas such as organizational leadership, policy-making, and social sciences, where career guidance and leadership intersect with broader societal goals​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
Global Relevance: The leadership models developed in this study are applicable not only in the UK but in educational systems around the world, particularly in countries looking to reform career education programs​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study provides adaptable leadership models that can be tailored to different schools, educational contexts, and policy environments, making the findings resilient to changes in educational policy or societal needs​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Adaptability: The models of leadership can be adjusted to fit various school structures, from traditional hierarchical models to more innovative distributed leadership approaches, ensuring their continued relevance and applicability​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
These potential research impacts highlight how this study on careers leadership can have significant and wide-ranging effects on educational practice, policy-making, and beyond.
