Long-term Impact: Over time, this study could serve as a foundational resource for further research on religious adaptation and modernization, influencing policy discussions on cultural preservation.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: These include anthropologists, ethnographers, media scholars, and policy-makers in cultural preservation. The Itako community themselves are also direct beneficiaries as their traditions are being recorded and shared.
Indirect Stakeholders: The broader Japanese public and international communities interested in cultural preservation and the effects of globalization on local practices are indirectly impacted.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study provides a profound contribution to the specialized field of Japanese religious practices, offering detailed documentation of how modernization is altering these spiritual roles.
Broad Impact: Beyond Japan, the study resonates globally with researchers studying how globalization and modernization affect local cultural practices. The visual ethnography methods used can also be applied in other regions to document cultural transitions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The visual and documentary methods employed could be scaled up to cover other regions where cultural traditions are endangered. This methodology can be expanded to study similar spiritual and cultural practices in rural areas worldwide.
Transferability: The interactive documentary approach used in the study can be transferred to other fields, such as digital humanities, and adapted for similar studies on cultural preservation and visual storytelling across the globe.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study employs visual ethnography to document the evolution of religious practices, an innovative method in anthropological research that enhances the study of cultures using digital tools.
Disruption: The research disrupts conventional ethnographic practices by moving beyond text-based documentation and incorporating interactive digital storytelling, offering new ways to engage with cultural data.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes the sustainability of intangible cultural heritage by documenting and preserving the practices of Itako shamans. The digital archive serves as a resource for future generations, ensuring that the tradition survives even as the physical practitioners dwindle.
Ethical Considerations: The research respects the agency of the Itako practitioners, ensuring that their narratives are told authentically, with ethical considerations regarding their portrayal and representation.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The interactive documentary can be utilized in cultural institutions, museums, and educational programs to teach about cultural preservation and modernization. The methods used are easy to adapt for other endangered cultural traditions globally.
Usability: By making the documentary available on open-access platforms, the research is highly usable by both academic and public audiences, encouraging wider engagement.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The study intersects fields such as cultural studies, religious anthropology, and digital media, showing its relevance across multiple disciplines. This integration makes the research influential in areas studying the impact of technology on cultural documentation.
Global Relevance: The themes of cultural preservation and modernization are globally significant. This study serves as a case for how similar practices in other countries could be documented and preserved amid globalization.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The documentation of the Itako practices showcases the resilience of traditional roles in the face of modern societal changes. The study itself reflects resilience in its method, capturing both traditional and modern aspects of cultural documentation.
Adaptability: The interactive documentary format is adaptable for other cultural contexts and can be used to document similar practices elsewhere, proving that this method can evolve with technological advancements.
These dimensions demonstrate the study's significant impact across academic, social, and cultural domains, highlighting its long-term relevance and the innovative use of technology for documenting disappearing cultural traditions.
