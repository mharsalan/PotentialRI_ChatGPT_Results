6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study introduces innovative and potentially disruptive methodologies:

Innovation: It introduces a new method of digital storytelling that blends interactive elements with traditional documentary formats. This innovation allows for more collaborative and participatory media production, empowering local voices in a new way.
Example: The interactive documentary provides an innovative approach to archiving and storytelling by allowing participants to co-create the content​(2 (1)).
Disruption: This research disrupts traditional documentary filmmaking by decentralizing the narrative and shifting control to the participants, fundamentally altering how documentaries are produced and consumed.
Example: It challenges conventional top-down media production methods by promoting participant-driven content creation​(2 (1))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The study focuses on promoting sustainable and ethical practices:

Sustainability: By giving local communities the tools to document their own histories, the study promotes long-term cultural and historical preservation. The use of digital tools ensures that the narratives remain accessible and sustainable for future generations.
Example: The creation of digital archives for marginalized communities ensures long-term preservation of cultural heritage​(2 (1)).
Ethical Considerations: The research emphasizes community ownership and ethical representation, ensuring that participants have control over how their stories are told.
Example: Ethical practices in co-creation ensure that marginalized voices are not exploited but rather empowered to control their own narratives​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
The methodologies developed in this research are highly usable in both academic and practical settings:

Implementation: Community organizations and local activists can directly implement the tools developed in this study to document and share their experiences. Educational institutions can also incorporate the interactive documentary into curricula on media studies and civic engagement.

Example: The documentary can be used as a tool in activist movements and social justice education​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The research offers practical insights into how interactive platforms can be used for social change and community-driven documentation, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Example: It provides a framework for how digital tools can be utilized by communities with limited resources to document their history​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
