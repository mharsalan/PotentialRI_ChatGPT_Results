To align with the study's focus, here is a breakdown of the Research Impact Dimensions based on the provided knowledge and study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study impacts several domains:

Academic: The research pushes forward the fields of media studies and interactive documentaries. It combines theoretical frameworks from documentary theory and digital storytelling with innovative approaches to social justice, creating new opportunities for academic research.
Social: By documenting precarious labor conditions, the study provides a valuable tool for social advocacy, engaging communities and raising awareness about labor rights in post-conflict societies.
Cultural: The interactive nature of the documentary aids in cultural preservation, allowing the local Bosnian community to document their history and cultural narratives.
Policy: The findings have potential implications for labor policy, potentially influencing discussions on economic justice and post-conflict recovery.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study could immediately influence public discourse and raise awareness of precarious labor through interactive public screenings and media engagement.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the interactive documentary format could change how researchers and activists use digital media to document labor and social justice issues, serving as a model for future projects.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Researchers, media practitioners, and community organizations will directly benefit from the documentaryâ€™s tools and methodologies. Local labor unions may also use the findings to push for labor reforms.
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader society, especially those in precarious labor or post-conflict regions, stands to benefit indirectly through increased awareness and potential policy reforms inspired by the documentary.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a deep impact on media studies, particularly by advancing the field of interactive documentary and pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling.
Broad Impact: The study reaches beyond academia, influencing the fields of activism, policy-making, and cultural heritage preservation.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The interactive documentary format can be scaled to address other global labor issues or be adapted for use in documenting other types of social justice struggles.
Transferability: The methodologies used in this research, such as interactive documentary creation and community engagement, can be applied across different geographical and cultural contexts, making them relevant for other post-conflict regions or marginalized communities.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The research introduces new methods of using interactive documentaries for documenting social issues, pushing the boundaries of co-creation and community-driven digital storytelling.
Disruption: By allowing participants to co-create content, this research challenges traditional top-down documentary production methods, promoting a more democratic approach to media creation.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The creation of a digital archive ensures that the narratives collected will be preserved for future generations, promoting long-term cultural sustainability.
Ethics: The study emphasizes ethical co-creation, ensuring that the community has control over their stories and that their experiences are not misrepresented.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The interactive documentary format is highly usable by activists, educators, and community organizers, who can implement the methodologies to document and advocate for other social justice issues.
Usability: The format allows for easy user interaction, making it accessible for a wide audience.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary: The research sits at the intersection of media studies, sociology, and labor rights, making it relevant for multiple disciplines.
Global Relevance: While the study is focused on Bosnia, its methodology can be applied to other regions and contexts, particularly those experiencing labor inequality or post-conflict recovery.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The research is adaptable to technological advancements, as the interactive documentary format can evolve with new digital tools and platforms.
Adaptability: The research can be adapted to other labor contexts or regions, making it relevant for a broad array of future projects in both developed and developing regions.
By following these dimensions, the study ensures that its research impacts are both broad and sustainable, influencing academia, society, and future research efforts.
