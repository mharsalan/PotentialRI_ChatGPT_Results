The file you provided outlines a framework for assessing research impact across 10 dimensions. I will now detail each dimension based on the study and the research impact dimensions from the file.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
This dimension highlights the various sectors or domains where the study has an impact. Based on your study:

Academic Impact: The study contributes to visual ethnography and religious studies, particularly with a focus on adapting traditional practices in modern contexts. It influences knowledge in anthropology, Japanese studies, and religious adaptation under changing social conditions.
Cultural Impact: By documenting the Itako shamans' practices in Japan and how they adapt to modernity, the study preserves and reflects on endangered cultural practices.
Social Impact: It also highlights how these shamans' evolving roles impact their communities, thereby influencing local community dynamics and raising awareness about marginalized cultural groups.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
This dimension assesses both the short-term and long-term impacts:

Short-term: The study offers immediate insights into how modernity impacts traditional roles like those of the Itako shamans, prompting further discourse on how global modernization affects local traditions.
Long-term: It could serve as a foundation for future studies on cultural adaptation, influencing long-term academic inquiry and discussions about preserving local traditions in an increasingly globalized world.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Scholars in anthropology, ethnography, religious studies, and Japanese cultural studies benefit directly from the study’s findings. Local communities and policymakers interested in cultural preservation also benefit from the study's insights.
Indirect Stakeholders: The wider public, particularly in Japan, and international scholars studying religious or cultural practices, can benefit from the awareness raised about the importance of preserving disappearing traditions.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study provides deep insights into the lives of Itako shamans and how modernization impacts their traditional practices. This study could reshape how anthropologists and cultural historians view adaptation in isolated rural regions.
Broad Impact: While the focus is niche, the findings could broadly influence how researchers across disciplines approach studies on cultural adaptation, modernization, and the global impact on local practices.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study’s methodology could be applied to other cultural groups experiencing similar changes due to modernity. The approach could be scaled up to document other traditional practices across different geographic locations.
Transferability: The visual ethnography techniques used in the study can be transferred to other fields such as documentary filmmaking, sociology, and cross-cultural studies, making this approach adaptable for various disciplines.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study employs visual ethnography to capture the transformation of religious practices. This innovative use of media in ethnography challenges traditional, text-only ethnographic methods.
Disruption: The study disrupts existing perceptions of shamanism and religious practice by providing a nuanced, evolving portrayal of the Itako shamans, showing them not as static cultural artifacts but as individuals navigating a modernizing world.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes the sustainability of cultural knowledge by documenting these practices before they disappear. By preserving these stories through visual media, it supports long-term cultural memory.
Ethical Considerations: The study ensures ethical treatment of its subjects, giving them a voice in how they are portrayed and ensuring that their cultural practices are represented accurately and respectfully.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research findings and methods can be applied in academic settings, particularly in media studies or visual ethnography courses. Community organizations focusing on cultural preservation could also use this model for documenting and preserving traditions.
Usability: The visual documentary format makes the study more accessible to non-academic audiences, which allows for broader public engagement with the research.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary: The study intersects multiple disciplines including religious studies, anthropology, media studies, and Japanese cultural studies.
Global Relevance: While the study focuses on Japan, its themes of modernization and cultural adaptation resonate globally. The methodologies could be applied to any region facing the erosion of traditional practices due to globalization.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study’s documentation of Itako practices in an evolving socio-cultural context highlights its resilience to the impacts of modernization. It demonstrates that traditional practices can adapt to contemporary challenges.
Adaptability: The methods and findings from this study can easily be adapted to other cultural contexts, allowing researchers to explore similar transformations in other global communities.
This detailed analysis reflects how the research fits within the 10 dimensions of research impact and highlights its potential influence on both academic and non-academic sectors. The study’s impact spans academic contributions, cultural preservation, and broader social engagement, making it a significant piece of research with far-reaching effects.
