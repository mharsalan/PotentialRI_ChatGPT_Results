Based on the research document you provided, I will now analyze the Research Impact Dimensions in detail, according to the framework for evaluating the impact of research. This assessment will focus on how the research addresses multiple areas and how it can influence academic, societal, technological, and cultural domains.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: The study's focus on using interactive documentary as a method of civic engagement and archiving advances the fields of digital humanities, media studies, and archival practices. The development of new frameworks for using interactive media to document social change influences both theory and practice in these disciplines​(1 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Social Domain: The study is deeply connected to the social domain by promoting civic action and community engagement through the creation of an interactive documentary. It encourages communities, especially those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to engage with their own histories and to create self-driven narratives. This can have a powerful effect on community empowerment and collective memory​(1 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediately, the interactive documentary can influence community engagement and local activism, serving as a tool for immediate civic action and archiving of histories in underrepresented communities​(1 (3)).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the theoretical frameworks developed in the research, particularly the idea of interactive documentary as a counter-archive, can shape future research in digital media, archiving, and civic engagement. This impact may persist as the methodology is adapted and expanded by other researchers or practitioners​(1 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The research directly benefits community activists, filmmakers, digital archivists, and media scholars. These groups can use the findings to create new forms of engagement with marginalized communities through interactive media​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: The broader public, particularly communities in post-conflict zones or areas with marginalized histories, are indirect beneficiaries. They can gain empowerment and visibility through the application of interactive documentary methods​(1 (3)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study has a profound impact on archival studies and documentary filmmaking by proposing interactive methods as tools for both archiving and activism. It presents a new way to think about how communities can preserve and engage with their histories​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Broad Impact: The study's application of digital tools in interactive documentaries crosses multiple fields, including media studies, sociology, and cultural studies. Its findings can influence how these fields use technology to engage with social justice issues​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The interactive documentary model developed in this study can be scaled to different regions and communities, especially in other post-conflict zones or areas with similar socio-political dynamics. The use of digital tools and interactive media can be adapted to larger projects focusing on global justice and historical memory​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The principles of interactive archiving can be transferred to other disciplines, such as education (to teach historical and civic lessons), journalism (to document underreported issues), and social activism (to promote human rights campaigns globally)​(1 (3)).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a novel use of interactive documentary as a means of building counter-archives. This challenges traditional methods of archiving, offering a more community-driven, decentralized approach to documenting history and social action​(1 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: By positioning interactive media as a tool for both archival preservation and activism, the study disrupts the conventional boundaries between media, history, and activism, creating a new hybrid space where these intersect​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes sustainable practices by ensuring that the digital tools it develops for archiving are accessible and usable by local communities. This supports the long-term preservation of histories that might otherwise be lost​(1 (3)).
Ethical Considerations: The ethical framework of the study is centered on community participation and agency. It ensures that the subjects of the documentary have a voice and control over how their histories are represented, addressing ethical concerns around representation and exploitation in media​(1 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research can be directly implemented by community organizations, filmmakers, and activists who wish to document local histories and social movements through interactive media. The tools and methods are designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to different contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The study offers practical methods for integrating interactive documentaries into both archival projects and civic campaigns, making it highly usable for practitioners in the fields of digital media, cultural heritage, and activism​(1 (3)).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research integrates media studies, sociology, archival practices, and digital humanities. It offers a framework that can be used by scholars and practitioners across these diverse fields, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The focus on community-driven archival practices in post-conflict areas makes the research globally relevant, especially in regions experiencing political unrest, displacement, or efforts to reclaim marginalized histories​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The theoretical framework and digital methods proposed in the study are adaptable to future technological advancements in interactive media and digital preservation, ensuring the study’s relevance even as media technologies evolve​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Adaptability: The interactive documentary model is highly adaptable to different cultural and political contexts, allowing communities worldwide to use it as a method of preserving their histories and advocating for social change​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
In summary, this study exhibits significant impact potential across academic, social, technological, and cultural domains. By advancing interactive documentary as a tool for civic engagement and archival preservation, it introduces innovative methods that have the potential to disrupt traditional approaches to media and archiving, while promoting sustainable and ethical practices in documenting history
