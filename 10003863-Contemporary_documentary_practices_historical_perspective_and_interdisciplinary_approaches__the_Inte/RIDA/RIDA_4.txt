To summarize the Research Impact Dimensions from the study based on the attached file and your predefined instructions, here is a detailed breakdown using the top 10 dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Impact: The study contributes significantly to interactive documentary studies, focusing on how documentaries can serve as tools for radical democracy. It advances the fields of media studies, digital storytelling, and sociology by providing a new framework for co-creation in media projects.
Social and Cultural Impact: By addressing the crisis of representation and enabling communities to document their own struggles (e.g., precarious labor conditions), the study impacts social justice movements and promotes cultural preservation through digital archives.
Policy Impact: The study could influence labor and media policy by demonstrating the power of participatory, web-based documentaries to mobilize communities and drive policy conversations.
Technological Impact: The research introduces innovative methods in interactive media, employing polyvocal storytelling and non-linear narratives, which are likely to influence the development of future digital media technologies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The research may have an immediate influence on how media practitioners and activists approach digital storytelling and interactive documentaries, leading to the rapid adoption of these techniques in social justice and community engagement projects.
Long-term Impact: The research has the potential for enduring impact as it lays the groundwork for future studies on the intersection of media and democracy, potentially influencing policy debates and labor rights advocacy over the long term.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The primary beneficiaries include media practitioners, documentary filmmakers, activists, and community organizations. These groups can adopt the interactive documentary methodologies to mobilize action and advocate for policy reforms.
Indirect Stakeholders: Policymakers and the general public will benefit indirectly, as the research could shape public discourse on representation in media and labor rights, leading to broader social change.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a profound influence within interactive documentary studies by redefining the role of the audience as co-creators. This deepens the understanding of participatory media and its use in addressing societal issues.
Broad Impact: Beyond media studies, the research’s impact reaches into fields such as political science, social activism, and policy studies, especially regarding civic engagement and digital democracy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The interactive documentary model proposed in the study can be scaled to other socio-political contexts, particularly in post-conflict or marginalized communities worldwide.
Transferability: The methodologies for co-creation and digital storytelling can be adapted across disciplines, including education, public health, and environmental activism, making the research highly transferable.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a polyvocal, non-linear narrative structure, which is innovative in the field of digital storytelling. This method disrupts traditional documentary filmmaking by transforming the audience from passive consumers into active participants.
Disruption: The research challenges existing paradigms of media representation and offers a new way to address the crisis of representation in media, particularly in portraying marginalized groups and labor conditions.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The research promotes cultural sustainability by creating digital archives that preserve local histories and narratives for future generations. It also encourages sustainable community-driven media practices.
Ethical Considerations: The study is ethically aligned with participatory research practices, ensuring that the subjects of the documentaries retain control over their narratives. This protects against exploitation and misrepresentation.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study’s methodologies can be implemented in various contexts, including community activism, education, and media production. The interactive format is particularly useful for social justice campaigns that require audience engagement.
Usability: The tools and frameworks for creating interactive documentaries are accessible to both professional media producers and grassroots activists, making them highly usable for a wide range of applications.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research bridges media studies, sociology, political science, and digital humanities, making it relevant to scholars across multiple disciplines.
Global Relevance: While the study focuses on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the issues of labor rights and representation in media are universal. The research has global applicability, particularly in regions experiencing political instability or economic inequality.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The interactive documentary format is resilient to technological changes, as the structure can evolve with new digital tools and platforms.
Adaptability: The research’s participatory methods can be adapted to various cultural contexts and evolving media technologies, ensuring its continued relevance in both academic and practical settings.
In summary, this study has the potential for deep academic contributions, broad social influence, and long-term impacts in policy and media practices. The research’s methodologies in interactive documentary creation offer scalable, transferable, and ethically sustainable tools for civic engagement, making the study highly relevant across multiple fields and sectors.
