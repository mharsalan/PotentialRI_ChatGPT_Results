Based on the study provided, "From Proletariat to Precariat: An Interactive Documentary Intervention in Northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina" by Amir Husak​(1 (3)), we can explore the Research Impact Pathways in detail, particularly for achieving the potential impacts identified both before and after publication. Below is a structured approach for maximizing impact through various pathways, leveraging productive interactions, community engagement, and strategic dissemination.

1. Pre-publication Pathways
The pre-publication phase is crucial for shaping the research to meet the needs of stakeholders and ensuring the results are grounded in real-world applications.

a. Community Engagement and Stakeholder Participation
Collaborative Workshops with Local Communities: To ground the project in the lived experiences of the people in Northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina, pre-publication workshops should be held with the local communities featured in the interactive documentary. This will allow for a deeper understanding of their experiences transitioning from a proletarian to a precarious labor structure. Engaging the community ensures that the documentary reflects authentic voices and experiences, fostering community ownership over the final product​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Engagement with Local Civic and Cultural Organizations: Establishing partnerships with civic groups and cultural institutions that represent marginalized communities or post-conflict societies is vital. These partnerships help tailor the research to the needs of these organizations, ensuring that the final interactive documentary serves both as an educational and activist tool​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
b. Methodological Development and Pilot Projects
Pilot Interactive Documentaries: Before the full-scale interactive documentary is published, it can be beneficial to develop smaller pilot versions to test its effectiveness in encouraging civic engagement and capturing historical narratives. This phase would allow for refining the digital platform’s usability and responsiveness to community needs. Such pilots can serve as case studies in academic discussions, while also providing immediate insights for refining the final product​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Theoretical Framework Refinement: As the study proposes a new theoretical framework of interactive documentary as a counter-archive, refining this framework through academic workshops and discussions before publication would help incorporate feedback from scholars in digital humanities, media studies, and archival studies​(1 (3))​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Pathways During Publication
During publication, the focus shifts to disseminating the research through both academic and public-facing channels to ensure it reaches a wide audience.

a. Academic and Scholarly Dissemination
Publishing in Open-Access Journals: To maximize academic impact, the findings and frameworks developed in the study should be published in open-access journals related to media studies, archival practices, and digital humanities. Open access ensures that researchers, educators, and practitioners in lower-resource regions (including Bosnia-Herzegovina) can access the work​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conference Presentations and Panel Discussions: Presenting the research at international conferences on interactive media, digital archiving, and post-conflict studies will facilitate discussions among scholars and practitioners on the potential of interactive documentaries for civic engagement and community archiving​(Research impact toolkit).
b. Public and Community Engagement
Local and International Media Coverage: Partnering with media outlets, particularly those focused on human rights, post-conflict recovery, or digital innovation, will help raise awareness of the interactive documentary and its underlying research. Media coverage can amplify the study’s findings, bringing attention to the plight of precarious labor in post-conflict regions​(Research impact toolkit).
Screenings and Interactive Events: Hosting public screenings and interactive workshops where participants can engage directly with the documentary will create spaces for dialogue on labor conditions and community history in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These events can be organized both locally and internationally to foster cross-cultural understanding and engagement​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Post-publication Pathways
After publication, it is essential to maintain momentum and foster long-term engagement and societal impact.

a. Academic Impact and Further Research
Integration into Educational Curricula: The research findings can be incorporated into the curricula of media studies and digital humanities programs worldwide. Interactive documentaries can serve as practical case studies for students learning about digital tools in archiving, civic media, and community-driven history​(Common Research Impact …).
Follow-up Research Collaborations: Establishing long-term research collaborations with academic institutions, particularly in post-conflict regions, can create opportunities to expand on the documentary’s methodologies. Future research could explore new ways of integrating community-driven archival methods into other historical and sociopolitical contexts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
b. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Policy on Archival Practices and Civic Media: The study’s insights into the role of interactive documentaries as counter-archives can influence policy discussions around archival practices in post-conflict regions. Advocacy efforts, in collaboration with cultural organizations and digital rights activists, can push for the adoption of more inclusive, participatory archival practices that empower local communities​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
Collaboration with NGOs and Human Rights Groups: Partnering with non-governmental organizations and human rights organizations can ensure that the research’s findings are applied in the field. NGOs can use the interactive documentary as a tool for raising awareness about labor conditions and economic precarity in post-conflict societies, shaping public opinion and informing advocacy strategies​(impact pathway).
c. Long-term Community and Cultural Engagement
Annual Interactive Documentary Festivals: Establishing an annual event focused on interactive documentaries for social change can promote ongoing engagement with the research. These festivals can be held in different regions, featuring screenings, workshops, and discussions that encourage cross-cultural learning and inspire new documentary projects​(Research impact toolkit).
Building Digital Archives for Future Generations: By collaborating with local institutions and digital archivists, the interactive documentary can serve as the foundation for a digital archive that preserves marginalized histories. This archive can be expanded over time, allowing future generations to engage with the historical narratives collected in the project​(1 (3))​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conclusion: Ensuring Sustained Impact
To ensure sustained societal, academic, and cultural impact, this study should employ a holistic approach that emphasizes both immediate outcomes and long-term engagement. By utilizing pre-publication collaborations, strategic dissemination, and ongoing post-publication advocacy, the research can continue to shape conversations around archival practices, digital media, and social justice for years to come.
