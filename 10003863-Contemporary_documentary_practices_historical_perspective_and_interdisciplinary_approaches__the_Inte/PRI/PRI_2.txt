Based on the study provided and after reviewing the research impact dimensions outlined in the sources, we can now identify several potential research impacts of this study. The impacts align with academic, social, cultural, and policy frameworks. Here are the key dimensions of research impact and how they relate to the study:

1. Academic Impact
This study contributes to academic knowledge in several key areas, particularly in interactive documentary filmmaking, media studies, and civic engagement:

Innovative Research on Interactive Media: The research introduces new methodologies for using interactive documentaries as tools for archiving and engaging in social justice. This not only expands the literature on digital storytelling but also offers a novel framework for how interactive media can document labor conditions and historical narratives​(Common Research Impact …).
Cross-disciplinary Influence: By incorporating insights from sociology, media studies, and digital humanities, this research demonstrates significant potential to influence multiple academic disciplines. It can serve as a case study in media education, and its methodologies can be adopted in future academic research, especially in digital archives and human rights documentation​(impact pathway).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
The study has notable social and cultural implications, primarily through its focus on engaging communities in post-conflict regions like Bosnia-Herzegovina:

Community Empowerment: By using interactive media to document precarious labor conditions, the study directly empowers communities to take control of their own narratives. This aligns with a broader cultural trend of co-creation in media, where communities participate in shaping the representation of their social realities​(Research impact toolkit).
Social Justice Advocacy: The research is inherently tied to social justice, as it gives voice to marginalized workers and explores the shifts from proletariat to precariat labor structures. This can catalyze further conversations around labor rights and inform social movements aimed at addressing economic inequity​(2 (1))​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Policy Influence
One of the potential long-term impacts of this research is its ability to shape policy at both local and international levels:

Influence on Labor Policy: By documenting the conditions of precarious labor in post-conflict societies, this research can inform labor policies that aim to improve the working conditions of marginalized workers. Its findings could be used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and policy advocates to argue for better labor protections and economic reforms​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Civic Engagement Policies: The research also contributes to discussions on how digital tools can be used to foster civic engagement. By showcasing how interactive media can engage citizens in archiving their own stories, it could influence policies related to digital inclusivity and community participation in governance​(impact pathway).
4. Environmental Impact
While this dimension may seem less directly relevant, the use of sustainable digital technologies to create interactive documentaries ensures minimal environmental footprint:

Digital Archiving for Sustainability: The focus on digital tools promotes sustainability in cultural archiving by reducing the need for physical materials (such as film reels or printed documentation) and supporting long-term preservation of cultural histories​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Economic Impact
The research also has potential to drive economic impact, particularly through its innovative use of interactive technology:

Digital Innovation and Economic Growth: The development and application of interactive documentary technologies could lead to economic benefits by creating new digital platforms or tools that could be commercialized. This aligns with the broader trend of technology-driven economic growth in the digital humanities​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Technological Advancement
This study pushes the boundaries of interactive documentary technology:

Advancements in Digital Storytelling: The research introduces new methodologies for integrating interactive features in documentaries, offering users a more immersive experience. This could pave the way for technological advancements in how media is consumed and how digital archives are built​(Research impact toolkit).
Tools for Future Research and Education: By using interactive digital platforms, the research creates a model that could be used in educational technologies or other applications within academia and beyond. For example, it could be used as a teaching tool in universities to educate students on digital storytelling and media studies​(impact pathway).
7. Public Awareness and Education
This study has strong implications for raising public awareness about labor conditions and civic engagement:

Raising Public Awareness: By documenting labor conditions in a post-conflict society, the interactive documentary raises awareness of the global issue of precarious labor. Public screenings and interactive participation events will help bring these issues to a wider audience, potentially fostering greater public engagement and awareness​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Educational Resource: The research has the potential to be used as an educational tool in schools, universities, and community organizations. By integrating the documentary into media and social justice curricula, it can serve as a learning resource to educate future generations about labor issues and the use of digital media in activism​(impact pathway).
8. Long-term Impact and Sustainability
The long-term impact of this research lies in its ability to remain relevant through technological adaptation and continuous engagement with its findings:

Sustainability of Cultural Heritage: The interactive nature of the documentary ensures that the cultural heritage of the region is preserved and accessible for future generations, which could inspire other post-conflict regions to document their own histories in a similar fashion​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Adaptability to Future Technologies: The research framework is adaptable to future advancements in digital archiving, ensuring that the impact of this research will endure even as technology evolves​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
In summary, the potential research impacts of this study are broad and multi-dimensional, ranging from academic advancements and social justice advocacy to policy influence, public education, and technological innovation. By addressing critical labor and social justice issues through interactive media, this research holds the potential to make a profound impact on cultural preservation, community empowerment, and digital storytelling practices.
