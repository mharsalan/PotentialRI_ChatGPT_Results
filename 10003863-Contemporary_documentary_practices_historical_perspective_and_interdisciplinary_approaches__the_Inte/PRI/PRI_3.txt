Based on the provided files and research impact frameworks, I will outline the potential research impacts of the study in as much detail as possible. The research impacts can be categorized across various dimensions as defined in your resources.

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Documentary Studies: The study contributes significantly to interactive documentary (i-docs) research, particularly by exploring how documentary formats can incorporate polyphony—multiple voices, experiences, and narratives—through participatory, digital means. This provides new avenues for academic exploration in media studies, digital humanities, and sociology.
Methodological Innovation: The development of a non-linear, interactive framework for storytelling based on Mikhail Bakhtin’s theories of polyphony and heteroglossia can reshape how scholars approach documentary filmmaking. The study introduces new methods of co-creation and the use of digital tools in participatory research, which can be integrated into various academic curricula​(Common Research Impact …)​(3).
2. Social Impact
Empowerment of Marginalized Communities: By involving community members as co-creators in the documentary process, the study empowers them to document their own experiences in precarious labor conditions. This social impact is seen in the way underrepresented voices are given platforms to share their realities, contributing to social justice movements and increased public awareness.
Raising Awareness of Labor Issues: The interactive nature of the documentary invites a wider audience to engage with the struggles of precarious workers in post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina, promoting public awareness and encouraging social change related to labor policies​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Policy Impact
Influencing Labor Policy: The documentation of labor conditions provides evidence-based insights that could influence labor rights advocacy. Policymakers can utilize the findings to advocate for improved labor protections, especially for precarious workers in post-conflict zones. This aligns with broader economic justice goals and could spark policy discussions on worker protections​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Shaping Cultural and Archival Policies: The study emphasizes the importance of digital archives for preserving community-driven historical records. It can influence how cultural preservation policies are shaped, particularly in ensuring that grassroots digital archives are supported and maintained for future generations​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation and Memory: By allowing local communities to document their own experiences, the research helps preserve cultural narratives in post-conflict societies. This can have a long-term cultural impact by ensuring that marginalized communities retain control over their historical and cultural heritage, contributing to efforts in cultural preservation​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Educational Impact
Integration into Curricula: The interactive documentary format can be utilized as a teaching tool in media studies, digital humanities, and sociology courses, helping students understand participatory media and the use of digital storytelling for social justice. It provides a hands-on example of how digital technologies can be applied to real-world problems​(Research impact toolkit).
Capacity Building: The research’s participatory approach involves training community members and students in digital storytelling, thereby building local capacity for future projects. This offers long-term educational benefits, as participants learn valuable skills that can be used for community-driven digital projects​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Economic Impact
Digital Innovation and Potential for Commercialization: The development of innovative interactive documentary tools has the potential to lead to the creation of digital platforms or software that can be applied in various fields. This can foster economic growth through the commercialization of digital tools for education, journalism, or social activism​(Common Research Impact …).
7. Environmental and Ethical Impact
Sustainable Digital Practices: The use of digital tools for archiving and storytelling reduces the environmental impact associated with traditional physical archives. By promoting digital sustainability, the study aligns with goals related to environmental preservation​(Research impact toolkit).
Ethical Considerations: The co-creation process ensures that participants are ethically engaged in the documentary process, with full control over how their stories are told. This prevents exploitation of marginalized communities and promotes ethical storytelling practices​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
8. Technological Impact
Advancing Digital Storytelling Tools: The research pushes the boundaries of interactive media technology by incorporating complex non-linear narrative structures and participatory features into the documentary. These advancements can be applied to future digital storytelling projects, potentially influencing how documentaries and interactive media are produced and consumed​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Health and Well-being Impact
Psychological Empowerment: Giving workers the tools to document their struggles and share their experiences can provide a sense of empowerment and psychological well-being, as participants feel that their stories are being heard and valued. This contributes to mental health improvements within the community​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Cross-disciplinary and Global Impact
Applicability Across Disciplines: The study’s methodology is cross-disciplinary, merging media studies, sociology, and political science. The interactive documentary format and co-creation processes are applicable across various fields, including education, public health, and human rights documentation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Global Relevance: The focus on precarious labor in post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina has global implications. Similar methodologies can be applied to other regions facing labor inequalities or post-conflict challenges, making the study relevant to international audiences and other socio-political contexts​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
These potential research impacts highlight the multidimensional influence of the study, which spans academic contributions, community empowerment, policy influence, and technological innovation. By addressing critical labor issues and utilizing digital technologies for participatory storytelling, the research has the potential to create sustained societal change across multiple sectors
