Based on the details extracted from the paper, I will now proceed to map the research against the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The research on altruism, especially focusing on "psychological altruism" and "ethical altruism" contributes broadly to moral philosophy, history, and psychology. It impacts academic, social, and historical domains.
Page Reference: Theoretical and historical exploration of altruism and its integration into late Victorian thought is detailed across various sections of the paper.
Example: The study enhances the understanding of moral history by connecting altruism's development in the 19th century to broader intellectual and social movements, affecting academic scholarship in multiple fields like moral philosophy, psychology, and history.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The impact of altruism as a moral philosophy began in the Victorian period but continues to shape ethical discourse today. The slow assimilation of the term into common use also highlights the long-term cultural shifts influenced by the research.
Page Reference: The history of the term "altruism" and its integration into moral lexicon is discussed on multiple pages, especially in discussions of 19th-century intellectual history.
Example: The research's influence spans long-term, shaping intellectual discourse around morality, ethics, and social responsibilities that have continued relevance in modern ethical debates.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: Researchers in moral philosophy, historians studying Victorian intellectual history, and social scientists investigating the development of ethical doctrines are the key direct stakeholders.
Page Reference: Stakeholders include moral philosophers and historians, as outlined in the analysis of the intellectual legacy of figures like George Eliot and Comte.
Example: Academic researchers directly benefit from this work, as it offers new perspectives on the history of ethics and altruism, informing both historical and contemporary ethical discussions.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research has a deep impact on the field of intellectual history and moral philosophy by redefining the concept of altruism. Its breadth extends to discussions in sociology, psychology, and even political theory.
Page Reference: The exploration of the Victorian "culture of altruism" and the blending of moral philosophy with social practice provides both deep and broad insights across disciplines.
Example: The deep impact lies in refining the understanding of altruism as a moral philosophy, while its broad influence reaches into social ethics, historical analysis, and political discourse across multiple sectors.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The theoretical insights into altruism could be transferred into modern discussions about ethics in various fields such as artificial intelligence and public policy.
Page Reference: Transferability of ethical concepts into new fields is implied in discussions about the legacy of altruism and its modern-day interpretations.
Example: Ethical frameworks discussed in the study can be transferred to modern debates on altruism in AI ethics, enhancing the research's applicability to current societal and technological challenges.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: The historical reframing of altruism disrupts conventional narratives about 19th-century intellectual history, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between religion, morality, and secular thought.
Page Reference: The research challenges traditional views on Victorian morality, as discussed throughout chapters dealing with Comte and the rise of altruism.
Example: By redefining the intellectual history of altruism, the research disrupts standard narratives, potentially influencing how modern scholars approach the study of moral history.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The study indirectly addresses the ethical implications of altruism by examining how it served as a moral foundation for public service, social reform, and ethical living in Victorian Britain.
Page Reference: Ethical considerations related to altruism are explored in discussions of key figures like Comte and Spencer.
Example: The research contributes to ethical discussions around public service and morality, offering insights into how altruism as an ethical doctrine can inform modern debates on societal sustainability and public welfare.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The research is highly implementable in academic curricula, particularly in courses on moral philosophy, intellectual history, and Victorian studies.
Page Reference: Theoretical discussions on altruism and its intellectual legacy provide practical applications for teaching Victorian intellectual history.
Example: The detailed historical analysis of altruism can be readily implemented in academic settings, providing students with rich case studies on the evolution of ethical thought.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The study crosses disciplinary boundaries by integrating moral philosophy, history, sociology, and political theory. Its relevance extends globally, as the concept of altruism affects social and political thought across cultures.
Page Reference: Discussions on the global spread of altruism and its intellectual origins are found throughout the paper.
Example: The research is globally relevant, offering insights into how altruism as a moral philosophy has influenced social and political movements in various cultural contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The resilience of altruism as a moral and ethical concept is demonstrated by its continued relevance in contemporary discussions on ethics, despite its 19th-century origins.
Page Reference: The adaptability of altruism over time, from Victorian society to modern ethical debates, is a key theme in the paper.
Example: The enduring relevance of altruism showcases its adaptability, influencing both historical studies and contemporary ethical discussions, ensuring its impact remains resilient over time.
Each of these dimensions is supported by the insights found throughout the paper and provides a comprehensive view of its broad and long-lasting research impact​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
