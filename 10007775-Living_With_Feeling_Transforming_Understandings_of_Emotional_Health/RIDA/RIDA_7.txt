I have reviewed the content from the two documents provided, and I will now assess the study titled ‘Purifying the Profession’: Good Character and the General Nursing Council Disciplinary Committee in the Inter-war Period based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Below is the detailed analysis, aligned with each dimension of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study primarily focuses on the historical evolution of character assessment in the nursing profession, especially through the lens of the General Nursing Council (GNC) disciplinary committee. It examines how character was perceived as critical to being a nurse, with influences from societal norms around class, gender, and morality. "For the first time, a formal judgment was required of when someone did not make a good nurse" (p. 3, Results).
Page Reference: Results, page 3.
Example: This research contributes significantly to the social and healthcare domains, offering insights into how gendered and class-based assumptions shaped professional standards in nursing, thus influencing current discourse on professionalism in healthcare.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study highlights that the GNC's influence on nursing character endured for decades, even after the Second World War, with character models continuing into the NHS period (p. 2, Results).
Page Reference: Results, page 2.
Example: The research contributes both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it adds to academic discourse on the evolution of nursing standards. In the long term, it forms a foundation for understanding modern nursing practices' historical roots in gender and class bias.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Stakeholders include the nursing profession, policy regulators, and historians. "For some matrons, an attempt to 'purify the profession' became one of the main functions of state registration" (p. 3, Results).
Page Reference: Results, page 3.
Example: The primary direct stakeholders are nurses and healthcare regulators, as it informs their understanding of the evolution of nursing standards. Indirect stakeholders include academics and historians studying the professionalization of nursing and gender roles in healthcare.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research deeply impacts our understanding of nursing ethics and its history. "The GNC’s disciplinary committee’s records reveal how personal and moral traits were considered essential to nursing practice" (p. 4, Discussion).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 4.
Example: The study has deep impact within the historical field of nursing and broad impact across social sciences, as it intersects with gender studies, class, and ethics in professional practices.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study's findings on the criteria for good character in nurses can be transferred to broader discussions on professional character in other fields. "Class and gender remained significant in the moral character of the nurse" (p. 6, Discussion).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 6.
Example: The research could influence discussions in other professional fields like medicine and law, where character assessments play a role, making it transferable to these contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study disrupts traditional views by highlighting how rigid character assessments based on class and gender are outdated. "The traits expected of a nurse are most definitely not timeless" (p. 2, Results).
Page Reference: Results, page 2.
Example: The research introduces a disruptive potential by challenging the historical paradigms of professionalism based on outdated gender norms, offering a new understanding of how these standards should evolve in modern contexts.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study touches on the ethical dilemmas faced by the GNC in determining a nurse’s character, including issues of fairness and justice. "The committee were roundly dismissive, unanimously declaring that the attitude expected of Johnson as a nurse did not extend to her private life" (p. 6, Discussion).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 6.
Example: By addressing the ethical issues involved in regulating nursing character, the research contributes to long-term discussions on professional ethics and the need for just, sustainable approaches to character assessments in various fields.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Nurses' personal lives were under significantly greater scrutiny" (p. 2, Methods). The insights from this research are applicable in nursing education and healthcare policy.
Page Reference: Methods, page 2.
Example: Usability lies in its application to modern nursing curricula and policy reforms, offering a historical perspective to shape current training and professional standards, ensuring that they are more inclusive and just.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study draws on historical analysis and gender studies, making it cross-disciplinary. "Historians have shown that nursing as a profession became more fragmented in the twentieth century" (p. 1, Introduction).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 1.
Example: The research has global relevance, contributing to broader discussions on gender roles in professional settings across disciplines such as sociology, gender studies, and nursing history.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study examines how character judgments in nursing have adapted over time, especially during periods of significant change, such as the transition into the NHS. "Expectations on nurses have changed alongside shifts in the status of nursing and the expectations on women in society" (p. 3, Results).
Page Reference: Results, page 3.
Example: The adaptability of the research lies in its relevance to evolving societal norms, illustrating how resilient the nursing profession has been in modifying its character standards to meet contemporary expectations.
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of how this study impacts various dimensions of research, including its historical, social, and professional relevance. Let me know if you'd like any further elaboration or specific details!
