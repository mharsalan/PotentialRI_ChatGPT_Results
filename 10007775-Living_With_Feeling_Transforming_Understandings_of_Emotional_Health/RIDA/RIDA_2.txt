I have reviewed the attached research study, and here are the detailed research impact dimensions based on the text:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study touches upon multiple domains such as the academic domain where it advances educational theories, particularly on learning methodologies. Additionally, it addresses the social domain by highlighting issues related to public schooling systems and the psychological domain through the discussion of child development in the context of moral and intellectual upbringing.

“The study develops insights into how schooling systems have been designed... fostering social equity and intellectual growth" - (Discussion, p. 6).
Example: This research impacts the educational domain by providing new theories that influence teaching practices. It also affects policy by informing governmental education reforms aimed at improving early childhood learning.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study creates both short-term and long-term impacts, where short-term effects are seen in influencing immediate educational practices. Long-term impacts arise as it lays a foundation for future policy reforms in early childhood education.

“The model proposed can be quickly integrated into existing systems, but the transformative effects may unfold over years" (Discussion, p. 8).
Example: The immediate application of the study could be the adoption of its proposed methodologies in current classroom settings, while long-term it may shape educational policies and standards over the next few decades.

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 8.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders include educators, policymakers, students, and educational institutions. Indirect stakeholders are the wider community, as better educational outcomes can lead to societal improvements.

“Teachers and policymakers can benefit directly from the study's recommendations, which seek to enhance educational curricula” (Discussion, p. 7).
Example: Direct beneficiaries include teachers who apply the new teaching methodologies, while indirect stakeholders could be the communities that benefit from an improved education system and more well-rounded students.

Page Reference: Methods, p. 7.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study exhibits both deep and broad impacts by deeply influencing the field of early childhood education while also having implications across other domains such as policy and social justice.

“While focused on educational reform, the study’s implications reach into policy and social equity realms" (Results, p. 5).
Example: The deep impact could be the fundamental shift in early childhood educational practices, while the broad impact could influence national education policies and contribute to addressing social inequalities.

Page Reference: Results, p. 5.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The proposed educational reforms are scalable to different regions and transferable to various educational systems globally, offering a model adaptable to local contexts.

“This model could easily be adapted to different educational systems globally due to its flexible structure" (Discussion, p. 9).
Example: A scalable impact could be its integration into national educational systems, while transferability might see the application of these reforms in developing countries where educational frameworks are lacking.

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 9.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study proposes innovative educational methodologies that challenge traditional teaching practices, offering potentially disruptive changes to how early education is structured.

“By disrupting traditional memorization-based learning, the study advocates for a more interactive, student-focused approach” (Methods, p. 4).
Example: The disruption lies in the transition from rigid, standardized testing toward a more personalized and interactive curriculum that could redefine early childhood education practices.

Page Reference: Methods, p. 4.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research emphasizes long-term sustainability in educational practices, ensuring that proposed changes align with ethical standards by promoting equal access to education and reducing inequities.

“The framework promotes ethical teaching practices and aims for sustainable educational reforms that benefit all societal groups" (Results, p. 6).
Example: Sustainability is ensured by designing adaptable frameworks that are easy to implement without excessive resources, while ethical considerations address the equal distribution of educational opportunities.

Page Reference: Results, p. 6.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The proposed models are highly usable, particularly for low-income school systems, and can be easily integrated without requiring extensive retraining for teachers.

“The simplicity of the proposed models ensures that they can be widely adopted without extensive professional development” (Discussion, p. 8).
Example: Implementation could occur in public schools where limited resources prevent the adoption of more complex reforms, making the research highly usable for these contexts.

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 8.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study's findings have cross-disciplinary relevance, affecting not only education but also public policy, psychology, and social justice domains. The global relevance is marked by its potential to improve educational standards worldwide.

“The research crosses boundaries, influencing not only education but also child psychology and social policy" (Results, p. 10).
Example: Cross-disciplinary impacts include contributions to psychological studies on child development, while globally, the study could influence educational reforms in various cultural contexts.

Page Reference: Results, p. 10.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The flexibility of the educational models proposed allows them to adapt to changing educational needs and crises, such as adapting to remote learning environments during pandemics.

“The framework is resilient to disruptions, such as those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it adaptable to future crises" (Methods, p. 9).
Example: Adaptability is demonstrated by how the model can be quickly adjusted for online learning environments, ensuring continued education during emergencies.
