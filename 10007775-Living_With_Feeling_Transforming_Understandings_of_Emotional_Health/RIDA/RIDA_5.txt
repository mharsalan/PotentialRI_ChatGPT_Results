Based on your research document and the top 10 dimensions of research impact outlined in the file, I have extracted details and mapped the findings to each dimension as per the provided guidelines:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research affects multiple domains by contributing to the understanding of emotions, particularly 'anger,' in both historical and cultural contexts. It questions the validity of modern psychological categories.
Section and Page: (Emotions: History, Culture, Society, page 5)
Example: This study contributes to the academic domain (history of emotions), the social domain (understanding public discourse around emotions), and the cultural domain (impact on modern interpretations of emotions like anger in social movements).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research has a long-term impact by influencing future discussions on the history of emotions and modern psychological categories.
Section and Page: (Introduction, page 1)
Example: Long-term impact will be seen in how historians and psychologists understand emotional categorizations and the implications for future psychological studies and therapies.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: Stakeholders include researchers of emotions, psychologists, social historians, and policymakers involved in mental health discourse.
Section and Page: (Discussion, page 6)
Example: Researchers will directly benefit from the insights on categorizing emotions, while policymakers could use these findings to inform mental health policies that do not over-rely on rigid emotional categories.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research provides deep insights into the historical context of emotions, specifically focusing on anger and its cultural portrayals over time.
Section and Page: (Results, page 21)
Example: The study has deep impacts on the niche academic field of history and emotions while also having broad implications across psychology, sociology, and cultural studies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The research method of combining historical analysis with modern emotion theories is transferable to other emotions like fear, love, or joy.
Section and Page: (Methods, page 3)
Example: This interdisciplinary method can be scaled and transferred to study other emotions or psychological states, allowing for broader academic and cultural applications.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The research disrupts traditional views of emotions by challenging the concept that emotions like anger are fixed, universal categories.
Section and Page: (Discussion, page 22)
Example: This disruption could lead to innovative approaches in both academic and therapeutic practices regarding emotional categorization and treatment.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research supports ethical considerations by advocating for the reevaluation of rigid psychological categories, which may reduce stigmatization in mental health.
Section and Page: (Conclusion, page 25)
Example: The ethical impact is seen in promoting mental health practices that are more adaptable and less reliant on harmful stereotypes, supporting long-term ethical mental health care.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The insights provided are highly usable for both academic researchers and mental health professionals in revising emotional frameworks.
Section and Page: (Application, page 24)
Example: Academics can incorporate these findings into future studies on emotions, while mental health practitioners can use them to create more personalized therapeutic approaches.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research crosses disciplines by integrating history, psychology, and cultural studies. It addresses global challenges related to mental health and emotional understanding.
Section and Page: (Introduction, page 4)
Example: The global relevance is apparent in the discussion of how different cultures and historical periods understand emotions, which has implications for worldwide mental health discourse.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The flexible approach to understanding emotions shows resilience by being applicable in various historical and modern contexts.
Section and Page: (Methods, page 6)
Example: The adaptability of this research allows for it to be applied in future studies that deal with different emotions or even entirely new psychological phenomena.
These findings reflect the broad and lasting impact the study has across multiple dimensions of research, providing valuable contributions to both academic and societal contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…) (Knowledge - Potential R…).
