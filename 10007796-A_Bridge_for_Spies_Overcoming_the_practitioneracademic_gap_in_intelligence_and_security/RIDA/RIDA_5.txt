Based on the attached study, "Adding Value to the Intelligence Community: What Role for Expert External Advice?" by Robert Dover (2020), and following the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is a detailed assessment of the research across these dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "External contributions were expected to augment covert collection and to provide open-source challenge to analysts, rather than to directly contribute to decision support" (p. 853). This illustrates how the research impacts both the academic domain and policy domain by advocating for changes in intelligence gathering methodologies.
Example: This research informs intelligence policy, recommending the establishment of an Open-Source Intelligence Agency, affecting national security protocols across different governmental bodies. It bridges the gap between academic research and intelligence operations, impacting policy-making.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Creating an Open-Source Intelligence Agency of commensurate size to primary intelligence organisations would enable decision support to be provided to all government departments" (p. 852). This highlights the potential long-term impact of the proposed organizational changes.
Example: The long-term impact could be the sustained influence on how intelligence agencies operate, providing a foundation for future policy shifts and improvements in intelligence gathering methods, which might be referenced in future academic research and government reforms.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "External experts ... could assist governments and their intelligence gathering organisations to conceptualise and mitigate these threats" (p. 854).
Example: Direct stakeholders include intelligence agencies and government policymakers who benefit from enhanced decision support. Indirect stakeholders are academics and research institutions whose work will be integrated more comprehensively into government decision-making processes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The article moves onto provide an assessment of the barriers present to the effective incorporation and engagement of external expertise into the intelligence community" (p. 854).
Example: This research has broad impact as it addresses issues across multiple sectors, including national security, academia, and policy development. It also has deep impact by critically examining existing intelligence models, leading to potential transformative changes in how intelligence is gathered and used.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The notion of external expert engagement is underexplored in the extant literature, but also in practitioner circles" (p. 855).
Example: The research on external expert involvement in intelligence agencies can be scaled to different national contexts beyond the UK. The framework for integrating academic expertise into intelligence operations can also be transferred to other fields, such as law enforcement or military intelligence.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "Creating an Open-Source Intelligence Agency of commensurate size ... would widen the pool of sources and experts" (p. 852).
Example: The suggestion to establish an Open-Source Intelligence Agency is a disruptive innovation in intelligence practices, challenging traditional closed-source models. This could significantly reshape how intelligence is collected and used, bringing in a broader range of expertise and technologies.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Secrecy ... has shaped and conditioned the intelligence community" (p. 857). The discussion on transparency in intelligence practices touches on ethical concerns related to secrecy.
Example: The proposed open-source approach introduces a more sustainable and ethical model for intelligence work, enhancing transparency and reducing reliance on covert methods that may pose ethical dilemmas.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Embedding engagement ... provides a good opportunity for the external expert to experience practitioner life on the inside" (p. 858).
Example: The research offers a practical, implementable solution for integrating external experts into intelligence operations, making the findings usable for intelligence agencies aiming to improve decision support processes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Contemporary security threats ... are enhanced by the tools of globalisation" (p. 852).
Example: The research has global relevance as it addresses international intelligence concerns, particularly in response to transnational threats like terrorism and pandemics, making the findings applicable across disciplines such as security studies, public health, and international relations.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The challenges of radicalisation and of international terrorism are the most obvious of a suite of challenges that suits a broader consultation of multinational and multilingual sources and experts" (p. 859).
Example: The adaptability of the intelligence community is enhanced by the researchâ€™s suggestion to broaden expert involvement, ensuring resilience against evolving global security threats by tapping into a diverse range of expertise.
This detailed assessment provides insights into how the study aligns with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, highlighting its broad potential to influence intelligence policy, interdisciplinary practices, and ethical intelligence operations.
