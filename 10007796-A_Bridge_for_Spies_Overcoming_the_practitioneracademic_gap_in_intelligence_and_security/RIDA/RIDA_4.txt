Based on the provided documents, I will now summarize the key research impact dimensions, in line with the top 10 dimensions outlined earlier. I will extract details from the paper and align them with each dimension, referencing key sections for your review.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research discussed in the paper focuses on the interaction between academia and government, specifically within the realm of national security and intelligence. The study explores how academics have contributed to government policy through projects like "Lessons Learned," where scholars are selected based on subject matter expertise to provide open-source challenges to the government (e.g., Whitehall) (p. 343-346).
Example: The research contributes to the policy domain by influencing government decision-making, particularly in intelligence analysis. This interdisciplinary approach also affects the academic domain, as it provides a channel for scholars to engage directly with policy development.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The long-term goal of the "Lessons Learned" project is to bridge the gap between academic research and government intelligence analysis. The collaboration has been ongoing since 2008, and the research outputs have influenced policy decisions over several years (p. 344-346).
Example: This research provides long-term impact by creating sustained channels for academic engagement in national security, shaping the future of intelligence analysis.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: Stakeholders include both government analysts who benefit from external academic expertise and academics who gain access to real-world policy impact. The wider public also indirectly benefits through improved national security policies (p. 346-347).
Example: Policymakers within government, academic researchers, and the intelligence community are direct stakeholders. The public benefits indirectly by receiving more informed government policies on national security.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The study shows deep impact by transforming how intelligence assessments are conducted in the UK. By incorporating academic insights, government intelligence bodies can challenge groupthink and provide more robust analysis (p. 344-347).
Example: The collaboration has a deep impact within the field of national security and intelligence, while its breadth is seen through its interdisciplinary nature, spanning academic research, government policy, and intelligence analysis.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The model of collaboration between academia and intelligence could potentially be scaled to other government sectors. The research suggests that similar projects could be transferred to other areas like defense and foreign policy (p. 348).
Example: The "Lessons Learned" framework can be scaled to other areas of government or transferred to different countries, enhancing policy-making across sectors.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: By engaging academics in intelligence analysis, the research introduces an innovative approach to challenge government practices that traditionally relied on closed, secretive methodologies. This has the potential to disrupt entrenched systems of intelligence by integrating open-source academic data (p. 346-349).
Example: The research disrupts traditional intelligence methods by embedding external academic viewpoints, creating a system of open-source intelligence evaluation.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The ethical challenges of balancing secrecy with transparency in government intelligence work are addressed. The project aims for sustainable engagement by ensuring that academic contributions are continuous and ethically aligned with public accountability (p. 349-350).
Example: The sustainability of this research lies in its goal to provide ongoing, ethical academic input into national security, ensuring long-term public trust in government intelligence.
Page Reference: Ethical Considerations, p. 349-350.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research findings are highly usable as they directly inform government policy, providing practical recommendations that are implemented through ongoing collaboration between academia and intelligence analysts (p. 348-350).
Example: The usability is seen in the integration of academic research into real-world intelligence assessments, making it easy for government bodies to adopt these findings.
Page Reference: Implementation in Policy, p. 348-350.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: This collaboration spans multiple disciplines, including intelligence studies, history, law, and political science, providing a global framework for how different sectors can improve intelligence analysis (p. 347-350).
Example: The cross-disciplinary approach enhances global relevance, making the framework applicable not just in the UK but in other national security contexts around the world.
Page Reference: Global Relevance, p. 347-350.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the need for intelligence systems to adapt to external academic challenges. The resilience of this model lies in its ability to continually evolve as new academic findings are integrated (p. 348-349).
Example: The adaptability of the research framework is seen in its evolution over four iterations, proving resilient to changes in both academic and government landscapes.
