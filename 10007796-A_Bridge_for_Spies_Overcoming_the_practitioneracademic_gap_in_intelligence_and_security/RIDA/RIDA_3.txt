Based on the documents reviewed, the research impact dimensions for the provided study can be detailed as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research delves into the concept of political risk and how power relations in politics affect decision-making across various sectors, including economic actors, religion, education, and the military. It also discusses how networks and political structures interconnect to influence governance and risk analysis​(3). Example: This research impacts multiple domains such as policy (informing governmental strategies for managing political risks), economics (affecting how companies make investment decisions), and security (enhancing approaches to national and international security management).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study highlights how political risk analysis is forward-looking, focusing on future risks rather than past occurrences, suggesting that the research is likely to have both immediate and long-term implications. The concepts introduced in the research, such as the application of network theory to political risk, could shape future academic studies and practical security strategies​(3) . Example: In the short term, the research could be used by companies to refine risk management strategies. In the long term, it may serve as foundational work that shapes the discipline of political risk analysis for years to come.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research affects multiple stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, security professionals, and academic researchers. It is explicitly designed to aid in decision-making for governments and businesses dealing with political risks, thus making them key direct beneficiaries . Example: Policymakers might use the findings to design more resilient policies in the face of political unrest, while businesses can adjust their international strategies based on political risk analysis.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study challenges existing paradigms in political science, suggesting that networks and chaos theory should replace the traditional equilibrium-focused approaches to politics. This has deep implications within political science, potentially redefining how scholars approach power and risk​(3). Example: This deep impact is likely to change how political science views and assesses political stability and risks, while the broad implications of the research could influence interdisciplinary studies in economics, security, and international relations.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The network theory applied in the study can be adapted to different fields beyond politics, such as economics and international law. Furthermore, the approach can be scaled from understanding political risks in individual countries to broader global applications​(3) . Example: The scalability of this research is evident in how network theory could be applied to global political systems, allowing multinational corporations to assess political risks on a global scale.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research introduces a novel application of chaos theory and network theory to political risk, which disrupts the traditional understanding of politics as a system tending towards equilibrium. This could lead to significant changes in both academic and practical approaches to risk management . Example: By challenging the conventional equilibrium-based models of political analysis, the research has the potential to disrupt the field of political risk management, influencing both academic discourse and corporate risk strategies.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding political risks in a holistic manner, taking into account various social, economic, and ethical factors. This approach encourages sustainability in risk management by considering long-term political stability and the well-being of affected populations . Example: Governments and businesses may adopt more sustainable and ethical approaches to decision-making by using the holistic methods proposed in the research, particularly in areas like international development and conflict resolution.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study is explicitly forward-looking, designed to be practical for use in real-world political risk assessments. It is structured to provide immediate applications in policy and business decision-making, especially in predicting future risks . Example: Businesses and policymakers can use the findings to implement more effective political risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that they are better prepared for future uncertainties.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research applies theories from physics, such as chaos theory, to politics, demonstrating its interdisciplinary nature. The discussion of political risks in global contexts further enhances its cross-disciplinary appeal . Example: The cross-disciplinary application of network theory could be relevant to other fields such as economics, sociology, and law, making the research applicable globally across different academic and practical domains.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study highlights the adaptability of networks in political systems, emphasizing the need for dynamic and resilient approaches to managing political risks in an ever-changing environment . Example: By understanding the adaptable nature of political networks, governments and organizations can build more resilient systems to manage political risks, ensuring that they are better equipped to handle crises in the future.

This breakdown covers the dimensions and provides detailed examples from the research, illustrating the broad and deep impact of the study across different domains.
