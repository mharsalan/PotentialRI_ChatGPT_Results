Based on my review of both the provided documents, here is a detailed assessment of the research impact across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research primarily impacts the policy domain by providing insights into enhancing collaboration between government (especially national security agencies) and academia. For example, the "Lessons Learned" project resulted in Whitehall officers using the findings to improve instrumental utility in policy-making (Discussion, page 4) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 4 .
Example: The research offers practical policy solutions for improving the use of academic expertise in governmental decision-making, notably in security, improving both the knowledge and methodologies used by policy-makers.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The long-term impact of this research is emphasized in its contribution to foundational changes in how the government incorporates academic input, potentially over decades. For instance, the importance of embedding engagement with academia as a systemic function in intelligence and policy-making is highlighted (Methods, page 16) .
Page Reference: Methods, page 16 .
Example: The findings may influence national security and intelligence practices for years to come by fostering ongoing collaboration between academia and government, leading to long-term knowledge enrichment in both domains.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary direct stakeholders include government agencies like the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office, while indirect stakeholders include the broader public that benefits from improved national security practices (Methods, page 3) .
Page Reference: Methods, page 3 .
Example: The national security community directly benefits from improved analytical methods, while the public indirectly benefits through enhanced governmental policy-making on security.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The project has deep impact on national security policy-making by improving information-sharing between academia and security agencies. The collaboration with the intelligence community to inform key policy decisions has far-reaching implications for how intelligence is handled (Discussion, page 17) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 17 .
Example: This research fundamentally improves the way intelligence services engage with academia, allowing for more accurate, well-rounded policy recommendations based on broader data pools.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research is transferable across different government departments and countries, given the universal challenges of national security and the need for informed policy-making. The methods developed could also be transferred to other fields requiring governmental collaboration with academia (Discussion, page 12) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 12 .
Example: A policy model developed for enhancing security could be scaled for different governmental sectors like health or education, transferring lessons from the security community to broader public policy domains.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research introduces innovative approaches by blending government needs with academic expertise. By formalizing how academia can provide real-time input into national security decisions, it disrupts traditional policy-making (Discussion, page 14) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 14 .
Example: The approach of engaging academia with intelligence analysis is innovative in its potential to disrupt traditional silos, allowing for faster, more accurate decisions through external expertise.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The project emphasizes sustainable collaboration between academia and government. Ethical considerations are included in terms of managing sensitive data while ensuring that intelligence-gathering processes benefit from the open intellectual contribution of academics (Discussion, page 19) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 19 .
Example: Ensuring that sensitive data is shared ethically while benefiting from the depth of academic research helps sustain the collaboration without compromising national security or ethical standards.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The usability of the research is high, as it provides direct insights for policy-makers that can be easily implemented to improve national security. The findings emphasize clear paths for integrating academic input into governmental processes (Discussion, page 12) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 12 .
Example: This research is directly usable by government bodies, offering clear guidelines on how to incorporate academic feedback into security and intelligence policies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research has global relevance, particularly for countries facing similar challenges in balancing security with public engagement. The methodologies used could apply to other countries seeking to improve intelligence-sharing practices (Discussion, page 19) .
Page Reference: Discussion, page 19 .
Example: This research could influence national security policies globally, serving as a model for other nations looking to improve collaboration between academics and government agencies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research demonstrates resilience by adapting academic knowledge to the ever-changing challenges of national security. The project evolves through different iterations, showing its ability to respond to shifting governmental needs and priorities (Methods, page 6) .
Page Reference: Methods, page 6 .
Example: The adaptability of the project is clear in how it has evolved to include interdisciplinary impacts and expand its reach across various government sectors, proving its long-term viability.
Each of these dimensions shows how the research can influence not just academia, but also government policy, public welfare, and international security.
