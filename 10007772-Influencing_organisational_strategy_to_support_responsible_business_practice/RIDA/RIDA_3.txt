Duration of Research Impact (RI)

Excerpts: "Our willingness to become an early adopter of the SBP will also allow us to build our credibility amongst our target market... long-term, but we envisage it will allow us to build and develop our brand." (Discussion, page 14)
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 14.
Example: Short-term impact is demonstrated through immediate visibility benefits, while long-term impact includes brand development and sustained environmental responsibility​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Stakeholder of Research Impact

Excerpts: "We incentivize our production employees by giving back a percentage of our turnover." (Methods, page 14)
Page Reference and Section: Methods, page 14.
Example: Stakeholders include employees (direct beneficiaries of profit-sharing), clients (who gain eco-certifications for their projects), and community groups that benefit from the business’s charity work​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Depth and Breadth of Impact

Example: The study showcases broad impact by reaching multiple sectors, including environmental sustainability and client engagement, but also deep impact in specific areas such as employee welfare and corporate sustainability​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Scalability and Transferability

Excerpts: "We provide sponsorship and assist local charities e.g., Xmas parties for OAPs, donations to Alzheimer’s Scotland and Diabetes Scotland." (Results, page 14)
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 14.
Example: The charitable and sustainability models discussed could be scaled beyond the local community to national or international levels, showing strong scalability and transferability​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Innovation and Disruption Potential

Excerpts: "We innovate by asking clients to choose their offset scheme when they order Climate Neutral printing from us." (Results, page 14)
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 14.
Example: Innovation is seen in giving clients customizable options for carbon offsetting, potentially disrupting traditional printing services and creating eco-friendly standards across the printing industry​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations

Excerpts: "Installing 192 Solar PV panels on their roof will generate 80% of their electricity requirements for 2016 onwards while reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 60%." (Results, page 14)
