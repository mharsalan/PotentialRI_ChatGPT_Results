To provide a detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions based on the attached study, I will now follow the 10 outlined dimensions for impact assessment. Here is the breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study titled "A Call to Address Grand Challenges" emphasizes the potential of operational research (OR) in addressing a wide array of societal challenges, specifically touching upon social, environmental, and policy-related domains.

"The grand challenges in Glasgow will be outlined in conversation with the Voluntary Action Fund, long-established Scottish grant maker..." - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: This research has the potential to influence policy-making in social and environmental spheres, especially in sustainability efforts through the collaboration with voluntary organizations.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research seeks to spark long-term solutions to enduring societal challenges, with particular focus on operational research methodologies that are capable of addressing both immediate and strategic, long-term issues.

"OR has considerable advantages to deal with strategic issues and grand challenges" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The impacts of this research could manifest in the short term through immediate applications of OR methodologies in voluntary action and sustainability projects, while its long-term impact could lie in fostering a legacy of operational research's contribution to solving global challenges.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research directly involves operational researchers, policymakers, voluntary organizations like the Voluntary Action Fund, and the broader community, including both local and international beneficiaries.

"The nature of the problems and issues in relation to the host of OR methodologies, tools, and techniques..." - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: Direct stakeholders include OR professionals and voluntary organizations working on social issues, while indirect stakeholders encompass communities benefitting from the addressed challenges, such as those receiving aid through the Voluntary Action Fund.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study combines a deep focus on OR methodologies with broad applicability across environmental, social, and economic domains. The depth is in operational research's rich tradition of solving complex issues, while the breadth extends to various societal sectors that OR can influence.

"Lane (2010) argued that OR has considerable advantages to deal with strategic issues and grand challenges" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The deep impact lies in advancing OR as a field, while its broad impact spans various societal issues, including sustainability, policy formation, and social welfare programs.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: OR's strength in scalability and transferability is evident in its ability to be applied to various societal challenges, not only in Glasgow but also on a global scale.

"Many will be equally applicable across Europe, and, indeed, worldwide" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The research's methodologies could be scaled from local projects to national or international initiatives, such as scaling sustainability practices across multiple countries or transferring OR techniques to other sectors like healthcare.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research fosters innovative use of operational research methodologies in addressing modern-day challenges, aiming to disrupt traditional approaches to problem-solving in the voluntary and social sectors.

"Explore how OR professionals can best promote and develop meaningful responses to make an impact" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The disruption potential lies in challenging conventional methods of addressing social and environmental issues by introducing OR-based solutions that could lead to more systematic, data-driven responses.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research engages with sustainability issues, particularly in addressing environmental and social challenges that align with ethical standards of fairness and long-term societal impact.

"In the area of sustainability, Weaver et al., (2013) found a limited number of contributions in ORS journals..." - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The focus on sustainability ensures that the research promotes long-term environmental and societal well-being, aligning with ethical considerations of improving quality of life without exploiting resources.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: This research emphasizes the usability of operational research methods to generate practical solutions for real-world challenges. By engaging with voluntary organizations and other stakeholders, the research ensures its findings are actionable.

"Next steps will be identified by the participants to be shared amongst the OR community..." - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The findings can be implemented directly by OR professionals and voluntary groups, making it easier to transition from theoretical research to practical applications in solving community-based challenges.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research brings together multiple disciplines—operational research, social policy, and environmental science—and its implications are relevant not only in Scotland but also globally.

"Many will be equally applicable across Europe, and, indeed, worldwide" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: Cross-disciplinary relevance is found in the integration of OR techniques with social and environmental disciplines, and the global relevance is underscored by the research's application across international contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: Operational research's history of adaptability is highlighted as it has addressed past challenges and continues to evolve in response to modern-day grand challenges.

"In the past saving millions of lives and protecting Britain, ultimately helping to liberate Europe" - Abstract, page 71​(2). Page Reference: Abstract, page 71 Example: The research is adaptable to future societal challenges, maintaining resilience in its ability to address evolving social, environmental, and economic problems, both locally and globally.
This analysis highlights the detailed impacts of the study across these ten dimensions, offering insights into its broad societal relevance and practical implications.
