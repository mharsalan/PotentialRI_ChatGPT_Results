3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpt: Stakeholders include governments, businesses, NGOs, and communities. The paper emphasizes the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to address systemic challenges .
Page Reference: Cross-sector partnerships for the SDGs .
Example: Local communities benefit from direct interventions designed to foster regenerative ecosystems, while businesses are incentivized to integrate sustainability into their operations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The paper offers both deep, specialized insights into sustainability systems (e.g., Theory U) and broad recommendations for cross-sector partnerships that span multiple domains like policy, business, and civil society .
Page Reference: Systems and systemic approaches for SDGs .
Example: Deep impact within sustainability research could redefine partnership models between non-profit and for-profit sectors, while the broad impact crosses into policy-making and education reform for sustainability.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The research provides frameworks that could be scaled from local community interventions to global policy recommendations. The systemic approach is highly transferable across various contexts, particularly in environmental conservation and economic policy .
Page Reference: Sustainable development through systemic partnerships .
Example: A local program for ecosystem regeneration could be scaled to national policies on environmental conservation, while principles from the research can be applied in diverse sectors such as urban planning and corporate sustainability.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: By applying new methodologies like systems thinking and cross-sector collaboration, the study disrupts traditional approaches to sustainability. It emphasizes cocreation and shared value creation between stakeholders .
Page Reference: Sections on Theory U and cocreation .
Example: The studyâ€™s emphasis on regenerative ecosystems and stakeholder cocreation could disrupt traditional, siloed methods of environmental and economic policy-making, leading to more integrated, systems-based solutions.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: Ethical considerations are central, focusing on equitable resource distribution, long-term sustainability, and the role of regenerative ecosystems in maintaining ecological balance .
Page Reference: Sections on systemic sustainability and partnerships for sustainable development .
Example: Ethical concerns addressed include ensuring marginalized communities benefit from sustainable development efforts and avoiding exacerbation of inequalities through economic policies.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The paper stresses the need for practical tools to implement sustainability goals through partnerships. These tools, such as boundary critique and systemic interventions, can be directly applied to policy frameworks .
Page Reference: Implementation tools in partnership building .
Example: Municipal governments could implement the findings through policies promoting sustainable urban ecosystems, and businesses might apply the recommendations in their corporate social responsibility strategies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The research is globally relevant, focusing on the SDGs, which are of worldwide importance. The systemic approach bridges various disciplines, such as environmental science, economics, and social governance, to address global challenges like climate change and poverty .
Page Reference: Global partnerships for SDG implementation .
Example: The research findings could be adopted across international bodies like the UN to influence global sustainability initiatives and frameworks.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The systemic approach advocated in the research is adaptable to different contexts, focusing on the resilience of ecosystems and communities in the face of global challenges such as climate change and economic instability .
Page Reference: Recommendations on building resilient systems .
Example: The frameworks proposed could help communities become more resilient to environmental shocks by fostering sustainable practices at the grassroots level and adapting these practices globally.
