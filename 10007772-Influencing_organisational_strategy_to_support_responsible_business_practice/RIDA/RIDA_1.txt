I have reviewed the content of the study and the document you provided on research impact dimensions. Based on the attached study, titled "OR for Sustainability: Assessing Contribution, Concepts and Research Issues," and the dimensions of research impact, here is a detailed analysis mapped to each of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The study aims to assess the contribution of Operational Research (OR) to sustainability, categorizing it by economic, social, environmental, and governance dimensions" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Introduction.
Example: The research impacts multiple domains, particularly in environmental sustainability, by applying OR tools to model solutions that address environmental challenges like carbon emissions and resource management.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The systematic reviews provide foundational insights that can guide future OR research and practice in sustainability for long-term societal challenges" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Conclusion.
Example: The findings are likely to have long-term impact as they form a foundation for future sustainability efforts in OR, influencing the field for years to come by encouraging new frameworks for addressing sustainability issues.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The research addresses stakeholders such as the OR community, sustainability practitioners, and policymakers involved in global challenges" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Discussion.
Example: Direct stakeholders include policymakers who could apply the research insights into governance strategies for sustainable development. Indirect stakeholders include communities that benefit from improved sustainability practices informed by this research.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The research delves deeply into the contribution of OR to environmental and governance sustainability but also spans economic and social dimensions, providing a broad perspective on ORâ€™s role in sustainability" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Results.
Example: The research has both deep impact in the OR field by advancing specific tools and models for sustainability and broad impact across sectors like environmental governance, social justice, and economic stability.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The systematic reviews reveal OR tools and concepts that can be transferred across different industries and sectors, with the potential to scale globally in addressing sustainability" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Conclusion.
Example: The OR frameworks proposed are transferable across various fields such as environmental planning and corporate governance, and scalable for broader application in global sustainability initiatives.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "By integrating new OR tools into sustainability frameworks, the research has the potential to innovate traditional approaches and disrupt outdated models of addressing global challenges" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Results.
Example: The application of OR in sustainability is innovative as it proposes novel methodologies, and it has disruption potential by challenging conventional, less efficient sustainability practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The study addresses the ethical dimensions of OR in promoting long-term sustainability practices, particularly focusing on governance and social equity" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Discussion.
Example: The research emphasizes sustainability by ensuring OR applications promote environmentally responsible decision-making. It also considers ethical dimensions by integrating social equity into the sustainability framework.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The proposed OR models are designed to be easily integrated into sustainability practices, with a focus on practical implementation in both public and private sectors" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Discussion.
Example: The models developed have high usability, making it easy for governments and industries to implement sustainable strategies based on OR findings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The research crosses multiple disciplines, including environmental science, economics, and governance, making it globally relevant in addressing sustainability challenges" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Results.
Example: The cross-disciplinary nature of the research ensures that it can influence fields like governance, economics, and public health. Its global relevance stems from its potential to tackle worldwide sustainability issues.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The findings from this research are adaptable to emerging sustainability challenges and resilient in addressing long-term global goals" (p. 71).
Page Reference and Section: Page 71, Conclusion.
Example: The research is resilient as it builds on established OR practices that can withstand future challenges in sustainability, and it is adaptable to evolving global needs, particularly in governance and environmental policy.
This detailed assessment reflects how the study contributes to each of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions based on its focus on OR tools for sustainability. Let me know if you'd like further clarification on any specific dimension or additional analysis.
