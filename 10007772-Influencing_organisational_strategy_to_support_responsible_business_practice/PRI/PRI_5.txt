Based on the comprehensive review of the study and the resources on potential research impacts, I have identified several specific research impacts aligned with the content of the study. These impacts are categorized according to common types of research impact dimensions and how they relate to the systems thinking approach applied to business and community value creation outlined in the study.

1. Academic Impact
The study contributes significantly to advancing theories of systems thinking and corporate social responsibility within the fields of business management and organizational studies. It introduces novel frameworks that bridge theoretical and practical applications, influencing future research directions in both areas.

Contribution to Knowledge: It deepens the understanding of how businesses can integrate community engagement into their core strategies using systems thinking.
Example: This research could serve as a foundation for further academic exploration of how businesses interact with societal and environmental systems, influencing curriculum development and academic discourse.
2. Social Impact
The research provides actionable strategies that have the potential to enhance community well-being by promoting value co-creation between businesses and local communities. This encourages companies to adopt socially responsible practices, which can lead to more equitable and sustainable business models.

Community Engagement and Participation: By advocating for community involvement in corporate decision-making, the study promotes the empowerment of local populations in business processes.
Example: As businesses implement these strategies, community groups may experience enhanced quality of life and social inclusion, fostering better relationships between corporate entities and the communities they serve.
3. Economic Impact
The study’s systems thinking framework emphasizes the long-term sustainability of business practices, potentially leading to cost savings for businesses by improving their relationships with stakeholders and enhancing corporate reputation. Furthermore, it encourages business practices that can lead to economic benefits through innovation in value co-creation and resource optimization.

Scalability and Transferability: The systems-based approach is applicable across various industries and geographic regions, offering the potential for businesses to scale these practices globally.
Example: A company adopting this approach may experience cost reductions, increased profitability, and enhanced corporate sustainability through better alignment with social and environmental values.
4. Environmental Impact
Sustainability is a core focus of the study, as it encourages businesses to consider their environmental footprint as part of their broader responsibility to society. The framework supports practices that promote environmental stewardship, such as reducing resource use and minimizing negative environmental impacts.

Sustainability and Ethical Considerations: The study advocates for ethical decision-making that integrates environmental concerns into business operations, aligning with global sustainability goals.
Example: Companies that adopt these practices could reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to broader environmental conservation efforts.
5. Policy Impact
The findings of this study have the potential to influence policy frameworks at both corporate and governmental levels by demonstrating how businesses can achieve competitive advantage through socially and environmentally responsible practices. Policymakers could use this research to shape regulations that encourage or mandate corporate social responsibility initiatives.

Policy Influence and Advocacy: The research could guide the development of policies that promote long-term sustainability and value-sharing between corporations and society.
Example: Governments may develop incentives or regulations encouraging businesses to engage more directly with community stakeholders and align their practices with sustainable development goals.
6. Technological and Process Innovation
The study offers a systems-based framework that could lead to process improvements in how businesses operate, particularly in their interactions with external stakeholders. This innovative approach encourages businesses to rethink traditional operational models, potentially leading to the development of new technologies or business processes that are more efficient and sustainable.

Innovation and Disruption Potential: The proposed systems thinking model could disrupt traditional profit-centric business practices, introducing new ways to measure success that include societal value.
Example: By focusing on systems that enhance both profitability and societal impact, businesses may innovate in areas such as supply chain management, corporate governance, or stakeholder engagement technologies.
7. Health and Well-being Impact
Although not directly health-related, the study’s focus on community engagement through business practices can have indirect effects on public health and well-being by improving the socio-economic conditions of communities involved with socially responsible companies.

Health and Well-being Impact: Engaging businesses in improving community infrastructure or contributing to local health initiatives can lead to enhanced public health outcomes, such as access to healthcare or improved living conditions.
Example: Businesses that co-create value with communities may invest in local health services or infrastructure, leading to better health and well-being outcomes for residents.
8. Behavioral Change
One of the key impacts of this research is its potential to change the way businesses think about their role in society. By framing community engagement as integral to business success, the study encourages behavioral change in corporate leadership and strategy.

Behavioral Change: The adoption of systems thinking encourages a shift from purely profit-driven models to those that prioritize sustainability and community value, altering corporate behaviors and decision-making.
Example: Business leaders who adopt these principles may influence industry-wide practices, leading to widespread changes in corporate behavior regarding social responsibility.
9. Global Relevance
The research is globally relevant, as the pressures on businesses to act responsibly towards both society and the environment are universal challenges. The framework could be adopted in diverse cultural and economic contexts, offering solutions that are adaptable to different business environments.

Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance: By integrating principles of systems thinking, corporate governance, and sustainability, the research is applicable across different industries and regions, especially in the context of global sustainability efforts.
Example: Multinational corporations operating in various countries could apply this research to harmonize their sustainability practices across different cultural and regulatory environments.
10. Cultural and Social Impact
The research promotes a cultural shift in how businesses perceive their role within society, advocating for a balance between profitability and social responsibility. This shift can have a broader social and cultural impact, influencing public perceptions of business ethics and corporate accountability.

Social and Cultural Impact: As businesses adopt more socially responsible practices, public trust in corporate entities may increase, and the cultural perception of businesses as contributors to societal well-being can be strengthened.
Example: Societal norms regarding corporate responsibility may evolve, with increased expectations for businesses to act as stewards of social and environmental progress.
Summary:
This study has the potential to create a wide array of impacts across multiple domains—academic, social, economic, environmental, and policy-related. By offering a systems-based framework for corporate social responsibility, it introduces innovative ways of thinking about business success that align profitability with societal and environmental value.
