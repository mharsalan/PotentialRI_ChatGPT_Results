Here is the research impact analysis based on the provided document and its alignment with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact.

1. Domains of Research Impact:
The study primarily explores the intersection of cultural, social, and religious domains, examining the experience of British-Pakistani Muslim communities with pilgrimage and the broader impact of globalization and transnational religious practices.

Excerpt: “The argument here, however, is that it would be wrong to argue that globalisation simply moulds all tradition into a standardised and homogenised fundamentalism.” (Page 282, Results Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The study contributes to understanding how religious practices, like pilgrimage, adapt in globalized contexts, offering insights for sociologists, policymakers, and community leaders involved in managing multicultural societies.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
The research on diaspora communities and pilgrimage likely has a long-term impact by providing foundational knowledge about religious and cultural adaptation in a globalized world.

Excerpt: "It highlights how British-Pakistanis’ pilgrimage decisions reflect socio-economic and cultural shifts.” (Page 282, Discussion Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Long-term impact could include shaping future studies on diaspora religiosity and informing public policy on cultural integration.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Key stakeholders include researchers in anthropology and sociology, diaspora communities, religious scholars, and policymakers.

Excerpt: “The study explores the dynamics of religious and cultural identity among British-Pakistanis.” (Page 282, Discussion Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Policymakers dealing with multicultural and religious diversity could use the insights to better understand the community dynamics and integrate inclusive policies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
The study has a deep impact within religious and cultural studies and a broad interdisciplinary impact across fields such as sociology, anthropology, and diaspora studies.

Excerpt: “The pilgrimage is both an individual and communal expression, blending religious traditions and modern socio-economic factors.” (Page 283, Discussion Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Deep in its focus on religious adaptation, but broadly influential in the global discussions on diaspora, identity, and transnationalism.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
The findings on religious practices and identity can be transferred to other diaspora communities facing similar socio-cultural transformations.

Excerpt: “It emphasizes that religious communities are imagined through shared symbols and metaphors.” (Page 283, Discussion Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research could be applied to other minority groups in globalized societies, scaling up to comparative studies on other migrant and religious communities.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
The study introduces innovative views on how religious identity and pilgrimage practices change in diasporic settings, potentially disrupting traditional views of static religious practices.

Excerpt: "Contemporary pilgrimage experiences challenge the traditional views of a static religious identity.” (Page 282, Results Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: This research could disrupt the academic understanding of pilgrimage by introducing the idea that globalized mobility fundamentally reshapes religious experiences.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
The research touches on sustainability by addressing how communities maintain religious traditions while adapting to modern, globalized contexts. Ethical considerations include the respectful portrayal of minority and religious practices.

Excerpt: “Religious actors navigate complex modern socio-economic contexts while maintaining traditional practices.” (Page 283, Results Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The study promotes ethical research on marginalized groups and encourages sustainability in maintaining cultural and religious identities in the diaspora.
8. Implementation and Usability:
While the study primarily contributes to theoretical knowledge, its findings can inform practical strategies for policymakers and community organizations working with diasporas.

Excerpt: “The research has implications for understanding how diasporas maintain cultural identities.” (Page 283, Results Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Community leaders could use the research to develop programs that support religious and cultural practices in diaspora contexts.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
The research crosses disciplines, relevant to fields like religious studies, migration studies, and global sociology, and has global relevance, particularly for Muslim communities in the diaspora.

Excerpt: “It explores the transnational religious imagination in a globalized world.” (Page 282, Introduction)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Its findings can be applied globally, offering comparative insights across various diaspora communities around the world.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
The study demonstrates how religious traditions show resilience and adaptability in new socio-cultural environments.

Excerpt: “The sacred and profane interact in complex ways during pilgrimage experiences, reflecting the adaptability of religious traditions.” (Page 282, Discussion Section)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The adaptability of British-Pakistani pilgrims in maintaining their religious practices amidst changing social and economic conditions offers a model for understanding resilience in other migrant communities.
This structured approach maps the study's research impacts across multiple dimensions and highlights its contribution to fields like sociology, religious studies, and global diaspora analysis.
