Based on the research paper titled "The Cultural and Political Economy of Hajj-going from Late Modern Britain: Glocal Pilgrim Markets and their Governance" and its analysis under the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here are the detailed assessments for each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research explores various domains, including cultural, political, and economic aspects of Hajj pilgrimage, focusing on British Muslims. It studies consumer capitalism, globalization, and neoliberal governance in relation to Hajj pilgrimages. This work intersects tourism, religion, and market dynamics (Introduction, pp. 3-5).
The paper also highlights social domains by examining how Hajj influences British Muslim identities and their engagement in a global religious practice (Results, pp. 10-11).
Page Reference:

Introduction, pp. 3-5; Results, pp. 10-11.
Example: The research impacts the academic domain by offering a detailed analysis of glocal religious practices in a Western minority context, impacting studies of globalization and minority religions. In the economic domain, it affects how Hajj markets are structured, offering insights into governance models in Saudi Arabia and the UK.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research addresses both short-term and long-term impacts on Hajj management, particularly with respect to market regulations, visa policies, and the broader structure of the Hajj industry (Discussion, pp. 8-12).
It discusses the long-term influence of neoliberal policies on Hajj-goers, particularly the enduring impact of globalization on religious tourism (Discussion, pp. 15-17).
Page Reference:

Discussion, pp. 8-12, 15-17.
Example: In the short-term, the study may inform immediate policy adjustments regarding UK Hajj regulations. Long-term, it provides a foundation for understanding the ongoing influence of neoliberal governance on the Hajj industry, influencing future research in religious tourism and economic policies in Muslim communities.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study identifies several stakeholders, including British Muslims, tour operators, Saudi authorities, and UK government bodies, showing how each plays a role in the governance and economic structures surrounding Hajj (Methods, pp. 6-8).
It also highlights community groups and religious leaders as key stakeholders in shaping the pilgrimage experience (Results, pp. 9-10).
Page Reference:

Methods, pp. 6-8; Results, pp. 9-10.
Example: British Muslim pilgrims and tour operators are direct stakeholders, benefiting from improved governance models and market structures. UK government bodies indirectly benefit by having better oversight of religious tourism impacting national security and social cohesion policies.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research has a deep impact in the field of religious studies and political economy, offering novel insights into the governance of religious tourism (Discussion, pp. 16-18).
The work has broad impact, touching on globalization, neoliberalism, and cultural identity, making it relevant to multiple disciplines, including sociology, political science, and cultural studies (Results, pp. 10-11).
Page Reference:

Discussion, pp. 16-18; Results, pp. 10-11.
Example: Deep impact is observed in how it redefines the relationship between Muslim minorities in the UK and their global religious practices. The broad impact lies in its cross-disciplinary influence, contributing to both religious and economic studies of globalization.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The research offers scalability by proposing frameworks for the regulation of religious tourism that could be applied not just in the UK but globally to other Muslim-minority contexts (Discussion, pp. 12-14).
Its insights into market-driven religious practices are transferable to studies of other religious pilgrimages and could influence global tourism policies (Results, pp. 10-11).
Page Reference:

Discussion, pp. 12-14; Results, pp. 10-11.
Example: The research's frameworks for improving the governance of Hajj travel can be scaled up to address pilgrimage markets in other countries with significant Muslim populations, while its market analysis could be transferred to different religious tourism sectors.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The study introduces innovative frameworks for understanding the intersection of religious pilgrimage and neoliberal governance, offering new ways to regulate and structure religious markets (Introduction, pp. 4-5).
It also discusses the disruption caused by global consumer capitalism on traditional Hajj practices, altering how British Muslims engage with the pilgrimage (Discussion, pp. 10-11).
Page Reference:

Introduction, pp. 4-5; Discussion, pp. 10-11.
Example: The study disrupts traditional understandings of religious pilgrimage by showing how modern economic forces, such as consumerism, shape the Hajj experience. This introduces innovative ways to manage religious tourism globally.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Ethical issues around the commercialization of Hajj are raised, particularly regarding the exploitation of pilgrims by market forces (Discussion, pp. 13-15).
The study also addresses the sustainability of Hajj infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, examining how over-commercialization threatens the spiritual integrity of the pilgrimage (Results, pp. 9-10).
Page Reference:

Discussion, pp. 13-15; Results, pp. 9-10.
Example: The research highlights the need for more sustainable policies that preserve the spiritual essence of Hajj while balancing market demands, ensuring that future generations can perform the pilgrimage without facing excessive commercialization.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The study provides actionable insights for policy makers and tour operators on improving the management of Hajj pilgrimages from the UK (Methods, pp. 6-8).
It also suggests practical solutions for enhancing pilgrim welfare and reducing instances of Hajj fraud through better governance (Results, pp. 11-12).
Page Reference:

Methods, pp. 6-8; Results, pp. 11-12.
Example: UK-based tour operators can implement the governance models proposed in the study to reduce fraud and improve the overall pilgrimage experience for British Muslims.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The study is cross-disciplinary, engaging with sociology, economics, political science, and religious studies (Introduction, pp. 3-5).
Its findings have global relevance, particularly in the study of Muslim diasporas and the globalization of religious practices (Discussion, pp. 10-11).
Page Reference:

Introduction, pp. 3-5; Discussion, pp. 10-11.
Example: The research is relevant to scholars worldwide studying religious pilgrimages, globalization, and minority communities, making it an essential contribution to cross-disciplinary discussions on religious tourism.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The study examines how the Hajj pilgrimage has adapted to the challenges of modernity and globalization, showing the resilience of British Muslims in maintaining their religious traditions in a market-driven world (Results, pp. 10-12).
It also highlights the adaptability of Hajj markets in response to changing governance and economic policies (Discussion, pp. 15-17).
Page Reference:

Results, pp. 10-12; Discussion, pp. 15-17.
Example: The research demonstrates the resilience of the Hajj pilgrimage, showing how it adapts to contemporary global challenges, including marketization and changing governance structures.

This analysis reflects the impact of the study across multiple research dimensions, providing valuable insights into the cultural, political, and economic governance of religious practices like the Hajj in a globalized world.
