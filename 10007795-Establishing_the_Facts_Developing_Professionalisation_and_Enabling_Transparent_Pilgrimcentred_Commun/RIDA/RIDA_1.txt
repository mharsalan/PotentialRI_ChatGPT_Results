To analyze the research's impact using the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I have provided a detailed breakdown based on the available data from the uploaded file.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research contributes to multiple domains, such as social (Hajj pilgrim welfare), policy (Hajj sector regulation), and educational (dissemination of knowledge about the UK’s Hajj sector).
"Mapping the UK’s Hajj Sector identifies the local and national significance of the commercialisation of global Hajj-going in Saudi Arabia for British Muslims"​(1).
Page Reference: Multiple domains including social, economic, and policy sectors​(1).

Example:

The research influences Hajj organizers and policy-makers, contributing to discussions in the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hajj and Umrah and influencing local Muslim communities’ awareness and understanding.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research has both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term impacts include changes in communication and governance within the Hajj sector. Long-term impacts relate to the evolving nature of Hajj-related governance and regulation .
"It also represents my own snapshot of a sector that is continually evolving" .
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

In the short term, the research facilitates more transparent dialogue and critical reflections among stakeholders. Long-term, it aids in evolving strategies for better regulation and professionalization of the UK Hajj sector .
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research affects direct stakeholders, including UK Hajj organizers, governance authorities, and British Muslim pilgrims. It also involves indirect stakeholders like Saudi governance and regulatory bodies.
"During 2018-19 three stakeholder consultations convened together with Seán and project research assistant, Wahida Shaffi"​(1).
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

Direct stakeholders such as the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah and the Council of British Hajjis are influenced by the research to improve governance and communication structures. Indirectly, future Hajj pilgrims benefit from improved systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research has both deep (field-specific) and broad (cross-disciplinary) impacts. Deep impacts include addressing specific Hajj-related fraud and the professionalization of the sector. Broad impacts span across governance, economic, and social disciplines​(1)​(1).
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

The research helps professionals in the Hajj sector (deep impact) while also influencing policy and public awareness (broad impact) regarding religious pilgrimages from the UK to Saudi Arabia​(1).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The research findings are highly scalable as they can be applied to other pilgrimage sectors, such as Umrah. They are also transferable to other industries involving cross-cultural interactions, regulation, and policy .
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

The consultations and findings regarding governance and fraud prevention within the Hajj sector can be applied to regulatory bodies dealing with international religious travel beyond the Hajj pilgrimage, such as Umrah​(1) .
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research introduces innovative approaches to governance and Hajj sector regulation, especially concerning fraud detection and professionalization.
"It also points to the need for further research, something addressed in the Conclusion" .
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

The project disrupts traditional perceptions of the Hajj sector by introducing more structured governance and regulatory models, especially relevant in fraud prevention and professionalizing Hajj operators .
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Ethical considerations are central to the research, particularly in ensuring transparency and fairness in the organization of Hajj-going from the UK. The research promotes ethical governance in the sector and fosters trust among stakeholders​(1).
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

The emphasis on transparency and stakeholder collaboration contributes to sustainable development in the Hajj sector, ensuring long-term ethical standards in pilgrimage operations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research has been implemented through various stakeholder consultations and has practical implications for improving governance and addressing fraud in the UK Hajj sector .
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

Practical implementations include improving the communication between UK Hajj organizers and pilgrims, leading to more efficient regulation and addressing Hajj-related fraud​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research is cross-disciplinary, touching on sociology, governance, and religious studies. It also has global relevance due to the international nature of Hajj​(1).
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

Findings from this research have implications for international stakeholders, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and can be transferred to other global contexts involving religious pilgrimages​(1).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research highlights the resilience of the UK Hajj sector and its adaptability in the face of changing governance structures and fraud issues​(1).
Page Reference: 13.

Example:

The research equips the UK Hajj sector to adapt to new regulatory frameworks and challenges, such as the rising costs and professionalization efforts​(1).
