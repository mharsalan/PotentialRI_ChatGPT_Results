Based on the details from the paper you uploaded and the "Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions" framework, I have mapped the research impact dimensions for the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study centers on "British Muslims’ experiences of Hajj and Umra," contributing to several domains:
Academic Domain: It provides new insights in anthropology, sociology of religion, and diaspora studies, particularly on "lived experiences" of pilgrimage (Introduction, page 41).
Cultural Domain: The research explores the intersection of migration, identity, and religion, contributing to the cultural understanding of British Muslim identities (page 46).
Social Domain: The study touches upon societal implications of pilgrimage as a marker of social status and personal religious revivalism within British Muslim communities (page 45).
Policy Domain: The involvement of the British Museum and AHRC-funded projects indicates potential policy implications in cultural preservation and museum curation (page 41-44).
Example: This research could inform cultural policy discussions and museum exhibits focused on Muslim heritage, directly influencing public engagement and educational programs in the UK.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study is likely to have a long-term impact as it contributes foundational knowledge on British Muslims’ religious practices and identities, influencing future research in the anthropology of Islam (Introduction, page 42).

Example: Over time, this research could shape further studies on religious practices in diasporic communities and inform ethnographic approaches to studying minority religions in the UK.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
Direct Stakeholders: British Muslim communities, anthropologists, and museum professionals are direct beneficiaries of this study. It also benefits cultural institutions like the British Museum.
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader British society and future generations, as this research helps increase understanding and representation of Muslim identities in public discourse and institutions (page 42).
Example: British Muslims could use this research to advocate for greater representation and inclusivity in UK institutions, while policymakers and educators can leverage the findings to foster multicultural awareness.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
Deep Impact: The research deeply affects the academic fields of religious studies and anthropology by providing nuanced perspectives on British Muslim pilgrimage experiences.
Broad Impact: It has broad implications across cultural, social, and educational domains, particularly in how British Muslims’ experiences are represented in public discourse (pages 45-48).
Example: This study can influence both academic debates on diaspora and public discussions about religious identity and multiculturalism in the UK.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings from this study are transferable to other contexts of diaspora and religious studies. The methodology and insights could be applied to studying other religious or cultural groups in different countries (page 43).

Example: The research methods used here could be applied to studying Muslim communities in the US or Europe, enhancing cross-cultural studies on migration and religion.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative perspectives by combining ethnography with sociological and religious studies, creating new ways to approach the study of lived religion in late-modern societies (page 42).

Example: It challenges traditional anthropological approaches by focusing on the performative aspects of religious subjectivity, potentially disrupting older paradigms that prioritize textual analysis over lived experience.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research reflects on the sustainability of religious practices in modern contexts, particularly how British Muslims negotiate their religious obligations in a secular society. Ethical considerations are addressed through anonymization of participants and sensitivity to personal narratives (page 46).

Example: The ethical handling of personal religious experiences in the study promotes responsible scholarship and could influence best practices in ethnographic research.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study’s insights are usable by cultural institutions (e.g., British Museum) to inform exhibit design and public engagement strategies related to Islamic culture (page 44).

Example: Museums could implement these findings to curate more inclusive and accurate representations of British Muslim experiences in their exhibits.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study’s cross-disciplinary relevance spans anthropology, sociology, religious studies, and museum studies. It also has global relevance, given the international scope of Muslim pilgrimage and diaspora experiences (page 44).

Example: Insights from this study can be applied globally, especially in countries with significant Muslim populations or diaspora communities, fostering international academic collaborations.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study reflects the resilience of British Muslim identities and the adaptability of religious practices in the face of modern challenges like globalization and secularization (page 47).

Example: By exploring how British Muslims adapt traditional religious practices to modern life, this research highlights the dynamic nature of religious identity and practice in a rapidly changing world.

This detailed assessment covers how the study on British Muslims' Hajj and Umra experiences impacts various research dimensions. The findings resonate across cultural, academic, and social domains, with significant long-term contributions to the understanding of diaspora religious practices.
