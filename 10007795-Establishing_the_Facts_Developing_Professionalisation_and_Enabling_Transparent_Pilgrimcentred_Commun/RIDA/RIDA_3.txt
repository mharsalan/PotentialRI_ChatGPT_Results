I have reviewed the study titled "Organising Hajj-going in Britain: A Preliminary Report" by Dr. Seán McLoughlin. Here is a detailed assessment of the research across the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions based on the information from the report:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The report impacts several domains, notably the social, economic, and policy domains. For example, the research "focuses upon the complex and changing dynamics of relations between Saudi Arabia, UK Hajj tour operators, pilgrim markets, British Muslim organisations and the agencies of the UK state and society" (Executive Summary, page 4). Additionally, the issue of "Hajj fraud" and its implications for "the informality of the organization" highlights its relevance in economic and legal terms (page 6).

Page Reference: Executive Summary, pages 4-6.

Example: The report contributes to the social domain by highlighting the changing expectations of British Muslim pilgrims in terms of class, gender, and generation. It also affects the economic domain through the discussion of the evolving UK Hajj industry, from small independent groups to organized tours that must meet Saudi regulations. The policy domain is addressed through the analysis of the UK's government engagement with Muslim communities regarding Hajj fraud and pilgrimage welfare.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research appears to have long-term impacts by mapping the evolving dynamics of Hajj organization in the UK and pointing towards the need for future studies and continued engagement with government bodies and UK Muslim communities (page 7).

Page Reference: Introduction, pages 7-8.

Example: The findings are likely to influence policy-making and community organization in the future, especially regarding the regulation of Hajj tours and the prevention of fraud. The report's recommendations for better self-regulation and knowledge of consumer rights have the potential for sustained policy changes.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research identifies key stakeholders including UK Hajj tour operators, British Muslim pilgrims, government bodies (e.g., the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), and Muslim welfare organizations such as The Association of British Hujjaj (page 7).

Page Reference: Sections on UK tour operators, Hajj fraud, and the British Hajj Delegation, pages 5-7, 23-25.

Example: Direct stakeholders include UK-based Hajj tour operators, who are directly impacted by the Ministry of Hajj’s regulatory changes and the pressure to provide a professional service. Indirect stakeholders are the broader UK Muslim community, who benefit from better-organized and regulated pilgrimage services.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research demonstrates both depth in its specialized focus on British Muslim Hajj practices and breadth by impacting multiple sectors, including travel, religious organizations, and government policy (page 15).

Page Reference: Section on the Growth of British Muslim Hajj-Going, pages 15-16.

Example: The study's deep impact lies in its contribution to understanding the complexities of organizing Hajj for the British Muslim population. Its broad impact spans beyond religious practice, influencing government policies and economic activities surrounding pilgrimage.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings on Hajj fraud and tour organization practices could be scaled to other minority Muslim communities in non-Muslim-majority countries, providing a model for better regulation and community engagement (page 7).

Page Reference: Section on Hajj fraud and British Muslim organizations, pages 23-25.

Example: The report’s analysis of Hajj organization in the UK can be transferred to other Western countries with growing Muslim populations, where similar challenges in pilgrimage organization and fraud may arise.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The research identifies the need for innovative solutions to prevent Hajj fraud and improve the regulatory framework governing tour operators. The suggestion that UK tour operators establish a self-regulating body presents a disruptive potential for the informal and sometimes unregulated nature of the industry (page 6).

Page Reference: Section on the Structure of the UK Hajj Industry and Hajj Fraud, pages 20-21.

Example: By proposing greater organization and formalization of the Hajj industry, the research introduces disruptive changes that could lead to more transparent and secure pilgrimage experiences for British Muslims.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The report addresses ethical issues such as the exploitation of pilgrims through fraud and the unregulated nature of some Hajj services. It also highlights the need for more sustainable business practices within the UK Hajj industry (page 6).

Page Reference: Section on Hajj fraud, pages 20-21.

Example: The call for better oversight and ethical regulation within the Hajj industry supports long-term sustainability in pilgrimage services, ensuring that vulnerable pilgrims are protected from fraudulent practices.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings are highly usable by policy-makers, community leaders, and tour operators, as they offer practical solutions for improving Hajj organization in the UK. The research is already making an impact, as the UK government has launched a national campaign on consumer rights in response to rising fraud (page 7).

Page Reference: Section on Pilgrim Welfare Organizations, pages 27-28.

Example: The report's insights into the structure of the Hajj industry and the importance of self-regulation are directly implementable by UK tour operators and government bodies.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research holds global relevance due to its examination of Hajj organization, a significant issue for Muslim communities worldwide. Its findings are applicable across disciplines, including religious studies, sociology, economics, and public policy (page 7).

Page Reference: Section on The Changing Hajj in Modern Saudi Arabia, pages 10-12.

Example: The study is relevant to global audiences, as many countries with Muslim minorities face similar challenges in regulating pilgrimage services.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research discusses the adaptability of British Muslim Hajj practices in response to changing regulatory frameworks and economic pressures. It emphasizes the resilience of the Hajj industry despite challenges like fraud and rising costs (page 5).

Page Reference: Section on the British Hajj Delegation and Pilgrim Welfare, pages 25-27.

Example: The adaptability of the UK Hajj industry to new Saudi regulations and the ongoing efforts to address Hajj fraud demonstrate the resilience of both the industry and the community in ensuring safe and meaningful pilgrimage experiences.

These findings reflect the multidimensional impact of the study on organizing Hajj-going in Britain.
