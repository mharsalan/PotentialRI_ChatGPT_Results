5. Environmental and Economic Impact
Economic Contributions through Tourism: The study explores how pilgrimage, as a form of religious tourism, impacts both the individuals participating and the broader economies of pilgrimage sites. Insights into this area can inform economic policies related to tourism management​(Research impact toolkit).

Sustainability of Pilgrimage Practices: It also touches on how religious tourism might affect environmental sustainability in pilgrimage sites, which can be of interest to both environmental policymakers and religious institutions​(Research impact toolkit).

6. Global Impact
Diaspora and Globalization Studies: By examining a global phenomenon (religious pilgrimage) through the lens of a specific diasporic group, the research has relevance beyond the UK, contributing to a global understanding of how religious identities evolve within migration contexts.

Example: It can inform comparative studies in different global contexts, expanding its reach beyond the immediate community under study​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
International Collaboration and Diplomacy: The study could foster international dialogue on the management of religious pilgrimages, contributing to diplomatic discussions around the management of large-scale religious gatherings and transnational religious practices​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Technological and Implementation Impact
Potential Use in Digital Platforms: The study’s findings on how pilgrimage decisions are made in a globalized, digital world could lead to the development of digital tools or platforms to facilitate religious travel and diaspora connectivity​(Research impact toolkit).

Public Engagement: The findings can be used to engage the public through media platforms, public talks, or social media, raising awareness of the diversity within Muslim communities and the complex interaction between religion and globalization​(Research Impact Knowled…).

8. Educational Impact
Influencing Educational Curricula: The study has potential to influence educational curricula related to diaspora studies, religious studies, and globalization. It could be included in courses on multiculturalism, migration, or religious practices in a globalized context​(Common Research Impact …).

Capacity Building: The research offers training opportunities for students and early-career researchers interested in fields such as religious studies, sociology, or migration studies, contributing to the development of human capital​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).

9. Ethical Considerations and Inclusivity
