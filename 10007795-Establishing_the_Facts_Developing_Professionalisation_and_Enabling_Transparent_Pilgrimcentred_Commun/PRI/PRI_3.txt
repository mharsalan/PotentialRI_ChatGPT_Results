Based on my review of the study titled "Organising Hajj-going in Britain: A Preliminary Report" and applying predefined research impact dimensions, here is a detailed analysis of the potential research impacts aligned with various types of impacts. This classification is designed to cover a range of research effects across different societal, academic, and policy domains.

1. Social and Cultural Impact
The research addresses social issues related to the British Muslim community's engagement with Hajj and the evolving expectations around this religious journey. It highlights how Hajj-going is influenced by factors like class, gender, and generation.

Cultural Practices: By documenting the practices of Hajj-going, this study preserves an essential aspect of British Muslim life, contributing to the cultural identity and heritage of the community. This is particularly relevant as the research provides insight into how the Hajj experience is adapting to contemporary pressures (such as formalization of the industry, growing regulation, etc.)​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

Social Change: The study shines a light on the issue of Hajj fraud, which affects vulnerable groups in the community. By raising awareness and providing recommendations on how to address this problem, the study can inspire social reforms and improved safeguards for Muslim pilgrims​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
The study has strong implications for policy-makers and advocacy groups that focus on religious tourism, regulation, and community welfare.

Government Engagement: The research informs UK government efforts in addressing Hajj-related issues, such as fraud and the need for better consumer rights protection for pilgrims. The study could directly inform policy changes in how the Hajj tour market is regulated, leading to more formal oversight of Hajj operators​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

Regulatory Framework: By highlighting the complexity of the Hajj organization and the challenges of informality, the study advocates for a regulatory framework that ensures fairness, transparency, and consumer protection in the Hajj travel industry. This could result in long-term legislative actions or initiatives from governmental bodies​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

3. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
The report delves into the economic dimension of Hajj tourism in Britain, exploring the transition from informal pilgrimage groups to regulated tour operators that comply with Saudi and UK regulations.

Tourism and Economy: The study's findings on the UK Hajj industry may influence economic development within religious tourism, a sector that contributes significantly to both the UK and Saudi economies. Recommendations from the report might guide economic policies that benefit small and large operators, creating a more standardized and profitable industry​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
4. Academic and Educational Impact
The study provides a theoretical and empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of Hajj organization within the British Muslim context. Its academic contribution is primarily within the fields of religious studies, sociology, and migration studies.

New Knowledge and Theory Development: The research significantly adds to academic discourse on British Islam and religious tourism. It is likely to be widely cited in future academic work on Muslim minority experiences, religious practices, and diaspora communities​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

Curriculum Development: The insights from this study can be incorporated into educational curricula on religious studies, tourism management, and community development, particularly in modules focusing on migration, culture, and religious tourism​(Research impact toolkit).

5. Health and Well-being Impact
Though the study primarily focuses on social and economic aspects of Hajj-going, there are implications for mental and spiritual well-being.

Pilgrim Welfare: The research touches upon the emotional and spiritual well-being of pilgrims, particularly how fraud and organizational chaos during Hajj can lead to emotional distress. Efforts to improve Hajj arrangements based on this study may lead to better mental health and well-being outcomes for pilgrims​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The study offers critical insights into the ethical concerns related to Hajj-going, especially concerning consumer exploitation and transparency.

Ethical Tourism: By advocating for better regulation and transparency in Hajj tour operations, the research promotes ethical standards in religious tourism. The recommendations for self-regulation by Hajj operators emphasize sustainable practices that ensure long-term consumer trust and satisfaction​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

Consumer Protection: The ethical dimension is further highlighted in the call for consumer protection against fraudulent practices. Implementing these protections can prevent future exploitation of vulnerable pilgrims​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research is relevant not only within the UK but also globally, where large Muslim diaspora communities face similar challenges in organizing religious pilgrimages.

Global Hajj Industry: The findings could be applied to other non-Muslim-majority countries with growing Muslim populations. The study offers a blueprint for tackling Hajj-related issues across different geographies, making it applicable in global contexts such as Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research touches upon a range of disciplines, including sociology, tourism management, religious studies, and economics, showcasing its cross-disciplinary nature and applicability​(Common Research Impact …).

8. Knowledge Dissemination and Communication
The study’s results have significant dissemination potential, offering insights that can be shared across academic, policy, and community networks.

Public Engagement: The findings can be disseminated through public forums, media engagements, and community outreach programs to raise awareness about the issues of Hajj organization and consumer protection. The study has the potential to generate discussions within the British Muslim community and encourage greater participation in policy advocacy​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Resilience and Adaptability
The research highlights the resilience of the Hajj industry in Britain, which has adapted to increased regulation, market changes, and cultural shifts.

Adaptation of Practices: The study demonstrates how British Hajj tour operators and pilgrims have adapted to new challenges, including tighter regulations from Saudi Arabia and the pressures of global tourism markets. This adaptability reflects the ongoing resilience of the Hajj industry in Britain​(impact pathway).
10. Capacity Building and Training
The research implicitly suggests the need for capacity building within the UK Hajj industry to improve organizational practices and consumer awareness.

Training for Hajj Operators: The recommendations for better regulation could lead to capacity-building initiatives, such as the training of Hajj operators in consumer rights, business ethics, and service management. This would strengthen the operational capacity of tour operators and improve service quality​(Research Impact Knowled…).
By exploring these various dimensions, the study on Hajj-going in Britain demonstrates a wide range of research impacts, from social change and economic implications to policy influence and academic contributions. These impacts reflect the study’s multifaceted contributions to British Muslim life, religious tourism, and community welfare.
