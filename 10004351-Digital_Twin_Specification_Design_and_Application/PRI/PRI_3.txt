The study titled "Toward Overcoming Accidental Complexity in Organisational Decision-Making" introduces significant potential research impacts, which can be mapped onto various Research Impact Dimensions as defined in the knowledge sources. Based on my analysis of the study and using predefined impact frameworks, here are the detailed potential research impacts:

1. Technological Advancement and Commercialization
Description: The study’s proposed framework integrates multiple enterprise modeling tools and introduces a bridge meta-model to reduce accidental complexity in decision-making. This has the potential to advance technologies in enterprise architecture (EA) and organizational decision-making software.
Example: The research can lead to the commercialization of software solutions that integrate diverse modeling tools such as i, BPMN, and system dynamics models*, allowing enterprises to streamline decision-making processes and reducing costs associated with managing complex IT systems​(3 (2))​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
Description: The application of the proposed model-based solution can reduce the time and effort needed for decision-making in large organizations. This would yield cost savings by improving efficiency and reducing resource waste, particularly in complex enterprise environments.
Example: By reducing the reliance on non-integrated tools, organizations could cut down on labor and operational costs, resulting in improved productivity and economic benefits, particularly during large-scale IT or organizational transformations​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy and Regulatory Impact
Description: The framework’s emphasis on integrating tools for decision-making can enhance regulatory compliance, ensuring that organizations meet standards in sectors such as finance and healthcare where regulatory oversight is high.
Example: The bridge meta-model allows for better compliance management by ensuring that decision-making processes and systems are aligned with regulatory frameworks, such as GDPR or financial regulations​(3 (2))​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Description: This study contributes significantly to enterprise architecture and organizational decision-making theory, advancing the field by addressing the problem of non-interoperable tools and offering an integrated solution.
Example: The study provides a foundation for further academic exploration into model-driven organizational frameworks, leading to advancements in how complex organizations manage and integrate decision-making processes across multiple domains​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The proposed solution is scalable to organizations of various sizes and industries, from SMEs to large multinational corporations, and transferable to different sectors such as public administration, healthcare, and manufacturing.
Example: The bridge meta-model can be scaled to fit the needs of a small enterprise as well as large, global companies, and its principles can be applied across sectors requiring precise decision-making and organizational optimization​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The framework integrates multiple tools and approaches across disciplines such as systems engineering, business process management, and information systems, making it relevant for global enterprises.
Example: The meta-model’s cross-disciplinary applications can impact industries globally, especially in multinational corporations operating in different regulatory and cultural environments. It helps align business objectives with IT systems across different sectors​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Social and Cultural Impact
Description: By addressing the complexities in organizational decision-making, the study contributes to creating more transparent and efficient organizational cultures. This can promote better corporate governance and ethical decision-making.
Example: The adoption of the integrated decision-making framework can lead to more open and accountable management structures in organizations, impacting corporate cultures by promoting transparency and collaboration​(3 (2)).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The framework encourages sustainable practices by optimizing decision-making processes and reducing the inefficiencies caused by fragmented tools. This contributes to better resource management and ethical governance.
Example: By promoting efficient use of organizational resources and aligning systems with regulatory requirements, the model contributes to both sustainable development goals and ethical business practices​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Implementation and Usability
Description: The study offers a framework that is highly implementable across various enterprise systems, as it integrates existing modeling tools, reducing the learning curve for organizations. Its usability in real-world enterprise environments is a key strength.
Example: Organizations can implement the bridge meta-model without overhauling their entire enterprise architecture, allowing for smoother transitions and better alignment of their business and IT processes​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
10. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The research disrupts traditional organizational decision-making by offering a new, integrated approach that addresses the limitations of existing enterprise modeling tools. The model challenges the reliance on separate, non-interoperable tools.
Example: The integration of multiple modeling languages into a single decision-making framework could lead to the disruption of legacy enterprise architecture tools, offering a more precise, efficient way of managing complex decisions​(3 (2))​(impact pathway).
Conclusion
The Model-Driven Organization framework presented in this study holds substantial potential to impact multiple sectors, including technology, economics, policy, and society. It offers innovations in enterprise architecture, promotes sustainability and ethical governance, and provides practical solutions that are scalable and transferable. These impacts align well with various Research Impact Dimensions, demonstrating the broad and deep influence this research can have in both academic and industry settings.
