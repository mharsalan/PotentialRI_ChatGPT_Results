Example: The framework could be adopted in university programs teaching enterprise architecture, becoming a foundational tool for students and researchers in the field. It also provides a basis for further exploration of precise modeling languages in enterprise system management​(1 (4))​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The LEAP framework is highly scalable, capable of being applied to both small businesses and large multinational enterprises. Additionally, its transferability makes it applicable across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and public administration, where precise modeling of complex systems is essential.
Example: LEAP could be scaled to manage enterprise architecture in large corporations and transferred to sectors like public healthcare systems, where aligning complex administrative and IT processes is critical for efficient service delivery​(1 (4))​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Social and Cultural Impact
Description: The precise alignment of business and IT systems as proposed by LEAP has the potential to transform organizational cultures, making companies more adaptive and transparent in their operations. The framework fosters a culture of rigorous system management and ethical compliance.
Example: LEAP’s emphasis on precision and compliance with regulatory standards could lead to better corporate transparency and ethical practices, thus influencing organizational behavior and corporate governance​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The LEAP framework contributes to the sustainability of organizations by ensuring that their IT systems are aligned with business objectives, reducing redundancies, and promoting resource efficiency. It also supports ethical governance by ensuring compliance with regulations and standards.
Example: By helping organizations comply with regulatory frameworks like GDPR and Sarbanes-Oxley, LEAP promotes ethical practices in managing sensitive information and IT processes, contributing to long-term sustainability and accountability​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: LEAP introduces an innovative approach to enterprise architecture by focusing on precision and model-driven engineering, addressing shortcomings in existing frameworks like ArchiMate. This has the potential to disrupt traditional enterprise architecture practices by setting new standards for precision in system design and business-IT alignment.
Example: The framework challenges the use of less precise tools in enterprise architecture, encouraging organizations to adopt more rigorous modeling standards that can transform how businesses manage and integrate their IT and business operations​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Implementation and Usability
Description: The LEAP framework is designed for ease of implementation, making it accessible for organizations of all sizes. Its use of standard modeling notations like UML ensures that it can be seamlessly integrated into existing IT infrastructure without requiring extensive retraining or new system overhauls.
Example: Organizations can quickly adopt LEAP without disrupting their current operations, using the framework to refine existing processes and improve system alignment in a cost-effective manner​(1 (4))​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The LEAP framework is relevant not only to enterprise architecture but also to cross-disciplinary fields such as business process management, strategic IT governance, and system engineering. Its global relevance is underscored by its applicability to multinational companies operating across different regulatory environments.
Example: LEAP’s precise modeling capabilities can be applied to diverse industries globally, helping companies in different regions optimize their enterprise architecture and ensure compliance with international standards​(1 (4))​(Research impact toolkit).
In summary, the LEAP framework offers substantial impacts across multiple dimensions, including technological advancement, economic efficiency, policy influence, scalability, and academic knowledge accumulation. By improving precision in enterprise architecture modeling and offering scalable solutions, LEAP has the potential to transform how organizations manage their IT systems and align them with business objectives. Its applicability across various industries and global relevance makes it a highly impactful research contribution.
