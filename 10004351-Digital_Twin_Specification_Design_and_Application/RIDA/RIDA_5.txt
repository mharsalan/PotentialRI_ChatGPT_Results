Based on the study and aligning it with predefined research impact dimensions, I have outlined the following research impact dimensions in detail:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The research impacts multiple domains, including the academic domain, technological domain, and economic domain. The primary focus is on enhancing enterprise modeling and actor-based simulations to aid complex business systems, especially in enterprise decision-making and digital twin technologies. It also influences the educational domain, where actor-based models are used to simulate complex structures such as university departments, aiding administrative and strategic decision-making.
Example: The study’s application of digital twins to academic settings could be extended to improve university rankings by analyzing teaching quality, research output, and student satisfaction, directly impacting academic governance.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The research promises both short-term impacts through immediate applications in the enterprise and educational sectors and long-term impacts by laying the groundwork for future advancements in simulation technologies and digital twins. Immediate impacts include improved decision-making frameworks for organizations.
Example: In the short-term, universities can use digital twins for academic planning, while in the long-term, the research will likely contribute to the broader use of actor-based modeling across various industries, particularly in enterprise planning and public policy.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The research benefits enterprise architects, policy-makers, university administrators, and public sector leaders. Direct stakeholders include organizations and universities seeking to optimize internal structures, while indirect stakeholders are the wider public, who may benefit from enhanced decision-making processes in organizations and governments.
Example: The ESL platform can be adopted by government bodies for simulating large-scale policy impacts, such as economic reforms, or by corporations for organizational strategy development.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Description: The research has deep impact in the fields of enterprise modeling and actor-based simulations, advancing understanding in these areas. The broad impact lies in its cross-sectoral applicability, spanning education, economics, and public administration.
Example: The study’s deep contribution to digital twin technologies in enterprise modeling has the potential to disrupt traditional approaches to organizational decision-making, while its broad influence is reflected in its application across universities, corporations, and governmental bodies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The research framework is highly scalable and can be applied across various organizational contexts, from universities to large corporations. Its transferability is evident in its potential application in policy-making, business processes, and healthcare.
Example: The ESL platform can be scaled up for use in national governments to simulate policy impacts on healthcare systems, or it can be transferred to large multinational corporations for improving organizational efficiency and decision-making.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The research introduces innovative actor-based simulation techniques that significantly disrupt traditional enterprise modeling by offering a real-time, adaptable simulation environment. It challenges existing decision-making frameworks by integrating digital twin technologies with actor-based abstraction.
Example: This research disrupts traditional enterprise decision-making by offering a unified simulation framework that can model both the structure and behavior of complex organizations, which may lead to the replacement of fragmented decision-making tools.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The framework promotes sustainable decision-making by enabling organizations to simulate potential outcomes of their decisions before implementing them, avoiding costly mistakes and reducing resource waste. The ethical implications include ensuring transparent decision-making in both public policy and corporate governance.
Example: By simulating policy outcomes such as economic reforms, the ESL platform helps governments avoid negative socio-economic impacts, thereby promoting sustainability and ethical governance.
8. Implementation and Usability
Description: The ESL platform is designed for easy implementation and usability in diverse contexts, including education, public policy, and enterprise systems. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to non-technical decision-makers, enhancing its adoption.
Example: Universities can implement ESL to optimize academic performance metrics, while corporations can use it to model and streamline business processes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The research has high cross-disciplinary relevance, merging insights from computer science, business management, and systems engineering. Its global relevance is underscored by its potential applications in diverse sectors, from education to public administration.
Example: The ESL platform’s ability to simulate complex, dynamic systems is globally relevant for industries dealing with large-scale planning and strategic decision-making, such as urban planning or national healthcare policy.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Description: The research framework is highly adaptable, capable of evolving alongside changes in organizational structures or policy environments. Its resilience is demonstrated by its ability to adapt to various decision-making contexts and unexpected challenges.
Example: The platform can be adapted for use in responding to global economic crises or emerging public health threats, making it a resilient tool for policy-makers and corporate leaders alike.
These dimensions reflect the study's potential to revolutionize enterprise decision-making, public policy simulation, and educational governance, with significant long-term and short-term impacts across multiple sectors.
