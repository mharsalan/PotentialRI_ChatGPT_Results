Based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact and the attached study, I will map out the potential Research Impact Dimensions for the study in detail as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study proposes the concept of a Model Driven Organization (MDO), which uses models to align an organization's strategic, tactical, and operational layers with its IT platform. This research primarily impacts the domains of Enterprise Architecture (EA), Information Systems, and Business Process Management.
Domains Impacted:
Technological Domain: The MDO vision advances Enterprise Architecture (EA) by providing a rigorous model-driven approach that impacts how organizations align business goals with IT infrastructure.
Economic Domain: The study's focus on improving organizational efficiency and alignment can lead to cost savings, influencing corporate strategy and resource optimization.
Policy Domain: Regulatory compliance is a key aspect of the study, suggesting potential impacts on corporate governance and policy frameworks related to data security and process integrity​(2 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The Model Driven Organization approach has both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term impacts include the immediate adoption of modeling tools to optimize enterprise IT systems. Long-term impacts involve the transformation of how organizations globally manage alignment across their systems and processes.
Short-term Impact: Companies can quickly implement MDO techniques for process optimization and alignment between business and IT, addressing immediate organizational challenges.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research may influence the development of international standards for enterprise modeling and compliance frameworks, creating an enduring impact on organizational governance​(2 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study impacts multiple stakeholders, including enterprise architects, IT professionals, business strategists, and regulatory bodies. By introducing a new approach to alignment through modeling, it directly benefits professionals involved in enterprise systems and governance.
Direct Stakeholders: Enterprise architects, business strategists, and IT consultants who use the MDO framework to improve alignment between business goals and IT systems.
Indirect Stakeholders: Regulators and compliance officers who benefit from enhanced reporting and compliance monitoring facilitated by the MDO approach​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The study has both deep and broad impacts. It deeply influences the field of enterprise architecture by addressing critical alignment challenges through model-driven engineering. Additionally, the approach has the potential to influence other fields such as business process management, compliance, and organizational theory.
Deep Impact: Within enterprise architecture, the MDO vision introduces a new paradigm for ensuring business-IT alignment, significantly advancing the field.
Broad Impact: The MDO concept could extend beyond enterprise systems to other domains like public administration and healthcare, where alignment and process optimization are also critical​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(2 (3)).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The MDO framework is designed to be both scalable and transferable. It can be applied to organizations of all sizes, from SMEs to large multinationals, and its principles can be transferred to other industries such as public sector institutions and service providers.
Scalability: MDO can be scaled to manage increasingly complex enterprise systems, making it suitable for large-scale multinational corporations.
Transferability: The framework can be transferred to other sectors like public administration and healthcare, where process optimization and IT alignment are critical​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(2 (3)).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The MDO concept introduces innovative methodologies by extending model-driven engineering (MDE) principles to organizational management. This disrupts traditional approaches to enterprise architecture by making models the primary means of organizational interaction.
Innovation: The use of models for directive development, resource planning, and regulatory compliance introduces innovative approaches to managing complex enterprise systems.
Disruption: MDO has the potential to disrupt existing enterprise architecture frameworks like TOGAF and ArchiMate, replacing them with more precise and dynamic modeling approaches​(2 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The study promotes sustainable practices by improving organizational efficiency and ensuring that IT systems are aligned with business objectives. It also addresses ethical considerations by focusing on transparency, regulatory compliance, and fair practices in system governance.
Sustainability: MDO contributes to long-term organizational sustainability by reducing operational inefficiencies and ensuring that organizations can adapt to changes in the business environment.
Ethical Considerations: By enhancing regulatory compliance and transparency, the study ensures that organizations operate ethically, aligning with both internal and external governance standards​(2 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the practical usability of the MDO framework, designed to be implemented across various industries and organizational types. Its reliance on model-driven engineering ensures that it is both technically rigorous and user-friendly.
Implementation: MDO can be easily integrated into existing enterprise systems, requiring minimal disruption to current processes.
Usability: The use of UML-style modeling and other standardized notations ensures that the framework is accessible to both IT professionals and business analysts​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(2 (3)).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The study’s principles can be applied across various disciplines, including systems engineering, business process management, and IT governance. Its global relevance is highlighted by its applicability in multinational organizations and industries operating in different regulatory environments.
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The MDO approach bridges disciplines such as business management, systems engineering, and enterprise architecture.
Global Relevance: The framework is relevant to organizations operating across international markets, especially those navigating cross-border regulatory compliance​(2 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the resilience of the MDO framework, highlighting its ability to adapt to changes in both business goals and external environmental factors.
Resilience: MDO allows organizations to remain flexible and responsive to changing business needs and external pressures, such as regulatory changes or market shifts.
Adaptability: The framework is adaptable to different organizational structures, ensuring its relevance across diverse industries and business contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(2 (3)).
In summary, this study introduces the Model Driven Organization concept, impacting multiple domains such as enterprise architecture, business management, and regulatory compliance. Its impacts are both deep within specific fields and broad across different sectors, with strong scalability, innovation potential, and ethical considerations. The framework is adaptable and transferable to various industries, making it relevant on a global scale.
