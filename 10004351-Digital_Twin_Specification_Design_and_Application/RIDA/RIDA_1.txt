Indirect Stakeholders: Businesses, particularly those undergoing acquisitions, mergers, or strategic shifts**, can benefit from more efficient IT alignment and reduced operational costs​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (4)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The LEAP framework provides deep impact in the specific field of enterprise architecture by addressing the precision and consistency issues in existing EA frameworks. Its principles can be applied across different sectors and broaden to include other business areas.
Deep Impact: In enterprise architecture, LEAP fundamentally enhances the ability to model business and IT systems.
Broad Impact: Beyond EA, the framework can be adapted to IT governance, strategic planning, and even regulatory compliance for organizations operating in highly regulated environments like healthcare and finance​(1 (4))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: LEAP can be scaled to larger organizations or more complex enterprise systems, and transferred to other fields such as business process optimization and system governance.
Scalability: The framework can expand from small-scale enterprises to multinational corporations, accommodating larger and more complex business models​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: LEAP’s model-driven approach could be applied to other fields requiring business process analysis, such as healthcare systems, public administration, and strategic IT governance​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: LEAP introduces an innovative approach to enterprise architecture by focusing on precision and leveraging UML-style modeling. It disrupts traditional EA methods by providing a more rigorous and flexible model-driven approach.
Innovation: The use of precise modeling languages to improve enterprise architecture analysis is a key innovation.
Disruption: LEAP challenges existing EA frameworks, offering a new standard for precision and business-IT alignment, potentially replacing less precise frameworks like ArchiMate​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: By promoting precision and compliance in enterprise systems, LEAP supports long-term sustainability for businesses by helping them optimize resources and ensure regulatory compliance.
Sustainability: LEAP helps businesses maintain sustainable growth by ensuring their IT systems align with business goals, thereby reducing inefficiencies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (4)).
Ethical Considerations: The framework also promotes ethical system governance by ensuring systems are aligned with compliance and regulatory standards like Sarbanes-Oxley​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (4)).
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: LEAP’s framework is designed to be practical and usable by both small and large enterprises, emphasizing ease of implementation through its precise and UML-based models.
Implementation: LEAP can be integrated into existing enterprise architecture systems without requiring extensive modifications, making it accessible for immediate use​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The framework’s use of UML-style modeling ensures that it can be easily understood and used by IT professionals and business analysts alike​(1 (4)).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: LEAP’s potential extends beyond enterprise architecture into fields like system engineering, business process management, and IT governance globally.
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The framework has applications in multiple fields, including business strategy, IT system governance, and strategic planning across various industries.
Global Relevance: LEAP’s principles can be applied to international businesses looking to standardize their enterprise processes across global operations, making it relevant to multinational companies​(1 (4))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: LEAP is adaptable to various business changes and can handle evolving organizational needs by refining models as organizations grow or shift their strategies.
Resilience: The model’s inherent flexibility allows it to adapt to changing business environments, making it a resilient solution for long-term enterprise architecture needs​(1 (4)).
Adaptability: As businesses grow or merge, LEAP’s framework can be refined to address new operational complexities, ensuring continued relevance and usefulness​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
These impact dimensions demonstrate how the LEAP framework can affect various stakeholders, industries, and organizational structures in the short and long term. Its broad applicability and precision offer significant value to enterprise architects and decision-makers in optimizing business processes and ensuring sustainable growth.
