Based on the content from the document and established Research Impact Dimensions, I will now provide detailed research impact dimensions for the attached study. The analysis is based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, focusing on how this research influences different domains, stakeholders, and broader impacts.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Description: This study addresses multiple domains, including Enterprise Architecture, Organizational Decision-Making, and Enterprise Modelling. It proposes a model-driven approach to overcoming complexity in decision-making, making the research applicable in both academic and professional practice.
Example: The framework impacts the technological domain by proposing solutions that could optimize decision-making processes in large organizations, and the economic domain by potentially reducing costs associated with inefficiencies in organizational structure and decision-making tools​(3 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The study offers both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term impacts include immediate enhancements in how enterprises manage decision-making using integrated tools. Long-term impacts involve the potential adoption of the model-driven approach across industries, establishing a foundation for future research in enterprise decision support.
Example: Short-term impacts can be seen in organizations that adopt the proposed method to reduce decision-making complexity, while long-term impacts might emerge through the widespread use of integrated enterprise modeling tools across different sectors​(3 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Description: The primary stakeholders include enterprise architects, decision-makers, IT professionals, and business managers who benefit directly from the improved processes this study introduces. Additionally, researchers in enterprise modeling will also gain from the theoretical advancements proposed.
Example: Enterprise decision-makers directly benefit by being able to integrate multiple decision-making tools efficiently, while indirect stakeholders like regulators may benefit from improved compliance and governance enabled by better organizational alignment​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (2)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Description: The research has a deep impact in the field of enterprise architecture and decision-making tools by proposing a meta-model that significantly improves how decisions are managed and operationalized across various organizational levels. The breadth of impact is seen in its potential application across multiple industries requiring complex decision-making frameworks.
Example: The study deeply influences enterprise architecture by proposing integration across tools like i, SnF, and BPMN*, and broadly impacts industries like healthcare, public administration, and finance, where strategic decision-making is essential​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (2)).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The study proposes solutions that are both scalable and transferable. The framework can scale to handle the complexity of large, multinational corporations and can be transferred to different industries, including government agencies and private enterprises.
Example: This framework could be transferred from technology firms to public health sectors, enabling better decision-making processes within different contexts, from IT projects to large public health interventions​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The study introduces an innovative approach to organizational decision-making by integrating diverse modeling tools into a single, cohesive framework. This disrupts traditional siloed approaches to enterprise modeling.
Example: The integration of different modeling languages (i*, SnF, BPMN) offers a disruptive innovation in how enterprises manage decision-making, providing a unified framework where previously non-interoperable tools are integrated for better efficiency​(3 (2)).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The proposed framework contributes to organizational sustainability by optimizing resource use and improving decision-making processes, reducing the likelihood of inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. It also raises ethical considerations in terms of governance, ensuring that decisions are made based on complete, integrated information.
Example: By ensuring regulatory compliance and optimizing decision-making processes, this study encourages organizations to operate more sustainably, reducing wasteful decisions and promoting more ethical governance practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Description: The framework is highly usable in practical settings due to its integration with existing tools like BPMN and i modeling*. This makes implementation in organizations more feasible without the need for significant overhauls in existing systems.
Example: The model is designed to be easily implemented across existing enterprise architecture systems, requiring minimal training for professionals who are already familiar with modeling tools like ArchiMate​(3 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The study’s approach can be applied across multiple disciplines, including information systems, business management, and IT governance, and is relevant globally, especially in large organizations that operate across different regulatory environments.
Example: The framework can be applied in multinational corporations and government organizations across various regions, making it globally relevant. It can help organizations operating in different regulatory environments to streamline their decision-making processes​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Description: The study's framework emphasizes resilience by allowing organizations to adapt to changes in both business goals and external environmental factors. It is designed to handle complex, changing environments, ensuring that decisions can be updated as new information becomes available.
Example: The model's ability to adapt to different organizational structures and regulatory changes ensures its long-term applicability, making it a resilient solution for organizations facing rapid changes in both technology and policy environments​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (2)).
Conclusion:
The study offers substantial research impact across multiple dimensions, including technological innovation, scalability, cross-disciplinary applications, and long-term sustainability. Its impact is both deep, influencing enterprise architecture and decision-making tools, and broad, with potential applications in industries worldwide. The study’s ability to integrate diverse tools into a cohesive framework provides disruptive innovation in enterprise modeling, ensuring better decision-making, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency across different sectors.
