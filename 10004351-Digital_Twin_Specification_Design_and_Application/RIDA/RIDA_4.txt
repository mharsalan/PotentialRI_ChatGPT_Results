After reviewing the contents of the attached study, here are the detailed Research Impact Dimensions aligned with predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The study contributes primarily to the academic domain by advancing knowledge in enterprise modeling, actor-based simulations, and decision-making frameworks. It impacts the technological domain through the development of the ESL platform for simulating emergent behaviors in organizational settings. Additionally, it influences the policy domain, as the case study on India's demonetization offers insights into how simulations can assist policymakers in managing complex socio-economic scenarios.
Example: The research affects enterprise architects, IT professionals, and policy analysts by providing a new framework for simulating decision-making in complex systems (e.g., demonetization in India), helping them evaluate real-world impacts using advanced modeling techniques​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The research presents both short-term impacts (e.g., immediate applications in enterprise architecture and decision-making) and long-term impacts (e.g., foundational contributions to the development of simulation tools like ESL).
Example: In the short-term, organizations could immediately use the ESL platform to simulate policy outcomes, while the long-term impact involves setting a foundation for future research in actor-based computational models and enterprise system optimization​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Description: The direct stakeholders include enterprise architects, software developers, and business managers, while indirect stakeholders include government bodies and regulatory agencies interested in improving decision-making and policy simulations.
Example: Government agencies might utilize the ESL platform for simulating public policy decisions, like demonetization, to predict socio-economic impacts, making informed choices and refining governance strategies​(4 (3)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Description: The research has deep impact within the fields of enterprise architecture and actor-based simulation. It provides a novel framework that significantly advances how complex decision-making processes are modeled. In terms of breadth, its approach crosses into fields such as public policy, economics, and software engineering.
Example: The deep impact is seen in its innovative approach to combining multiple modeling tools, while the broad impact is evidenced by its application to different sectors, including economic policy and IT management​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The framework is highly scalable and can be applied to various organizational sizes, from small businesses to multinational corporations. It is also transferable across sectors such as public administration, finance, and education.
Example: The ESL platform can be scaled up to simulate large-scale policy decisions (e.g., national monetary policies) and transferred to different contexts like public health management or environmental policy analysis​(4 (3)).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The study introduces innovative concepts in emergent behavior simulation and has the potential to disrupt traditional decision-making models by offering a more precise, adaptable solution for handling complex socio-technical systems.
Example: By integrating actor-based models with traditional enterprise simulation tools, the study disrupts the existing fragmented approaches to decision-making, providing a unified system that enhances the precision of real-world policy simulations​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The study contributes to sustainability by optimizing resource use in enterprise decision-making and improving long-term governance strategies through simulations. Ethical considerations are addressed by using simulations to anticipate unintended societal consequences of policy decisions (e.g., demonetization).
Example: By predicting the social and economic impacts of policies such as demonetization, the framework helps avoid negative societal outcomes, promoting ethical governance and sustainable socio-economic practices​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Description: The ESL platform is designed for easy implementation across a wide range of organizational contexts, particularly in enterprise architecture and public policy. Its usability is enhanced by real-time simulations and graphical analysis tools that make it accessible for non-technical decision-makers.
Example: Policy analysts can quickly adopt the platform to simulate economic policies, reducing complexity in decision-making and allowing for what-if scenarios without extensive technical knowledge​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The research is highly cross-disciplinary, blending insights from computer science, public policy, economics, and systems engineering. Its global relevance is demonstrated through its application to international policy challenges, such as economic crises.
Example: The ESL platform could be used globally to simulate the socio-economic impacts of policies like currency reform or climate change adaptation, providing governments worldwide with a robust tool for managing complex policy decisions​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Description: The framework is designed to be resilient by remaining applicable across various evolving organizational contexts and adaptable as new challenges emerge, such as changing regulatory environments or unexpected economic shocks.
Example: The platform's adaptability is shown in its use for emergent policy challenges, such as the rapid economic consequences of demonetization, allowing for real-time decision adjustments as new information becomes available​(4 (3))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
In summary, the study presents a wide array of potential impacts across academic, technological, policy, and economic domains, with robust scalability, cross-disciplinary applications, and potential for significant global relevance.
