To assess the research impact dimensions from the study "Navigating Inclusion in Transitions from Conflict: The Formalised Political Unsettlement" by Christine Bell and Jan Pospisil, I will follow the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact"​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt:

"The project of ensuring that political settlements are inclusive is key to attempts to navigate transitions from conflict over the last quarter of a century or so. Examining such transitions, we point to the emergence of the ‘formalised political unsettlement’ as a persistent outcome" (Abstract, page 1)​(2).
"Our focus is on fragile and conflict-affected states, which have undergone forms of peace process or formalised processes of reconfiguring the political settlement to be more inclusive" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 3)​(2).
Example:

The study influences policy by informing how peace processes can be designed to accommodate both elite and societal inclusion in fragile states. It also touches upon the legal domain by addressing institutional designs in post-conflict environments.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt:

"We suggest that the formalised political unsettlement may be here to stay, we point to the opportunities for navigating between elite inclusion and broader societal inclusion that it offers" (Introduction, page 1)​(2).
Example:

The research has a long-term impact by laying a foundation for understanding peacebuilding strategies and transitions from conflict over decades. It also influences future academic research and policy frameworks regarding conflict resolution.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt:

"Aid organisations increasingly assert the importance of understanding political settlements if aid interventions are to be effective" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 2)​(2).
Example:

Direct stakeholders: Policymakers involved in peacebuilding and conflict resolution, aid organizations, and international legal bodies.
Indirect stakeholders: Local communities in fragile states, benefiting from the stability and inclusion the study promotes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt:

"The formalised political unsettlement translates the disagreement at the heart of the conflict into a set of political and legal institutions for continuing negotiation" (Abstract, page 1)​(2).
Example:

Deep impact: The research offers a transformative view on conflict resolution, particularly in the concept of the 'formalised political unsettlement.'
Broad impact: This concept crosses domains, affecting international relations, peace studies, and legal frameworks for conflict resolution.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt:

"Since 1990, over 103 jurisdictions and conflicts have seen over 1500 negotiated peace agreements" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 4)​(2).
Example:

Scalability: The principles of political inclusion and settlement negotiation in conflict regions can be applied across different conflict zones globally.
Transferability: These frameworks can be adapted to other forms of governance and conflict resolution, including climate change migration crises or civil unrest.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt:

"The formalised political unsettlement is so-termed because it creates a state with political and legal institutions that ‘contain’ as much as resolve the conflict" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 5)​(2).
Example:

Innovation: The study introduces a new way to understand political stability by institutionalizing conflict through ongoing negotiation, challenging the traditional approach of seeking absolute resolution.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt:

"It creates a state with domestic institutions that have fluid and transnational dimensions that give the formalised unsettlement the character of enduring transformation" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 5)​(2).
Example:

The research promotes sustainable conflict resolution by focusing on long-term negotiation and adaptability in post-conflict governance, offering ethical approaches to inclusion without forcing immediate closure to conflicts.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt:

"Aid organisations increasingly assert the importance of understanding political settlements if aid interventions are to be effective" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 2)​(2).
Example:

Usability: The insights provided in the study are applicable for practitioners designing peace agreements and political settlements, especially for international agencies and NGOs involved in state reconstruction efforts.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt:

"We suggest that the institutions of the peace settlement result not in political settlement—as in an agreed state with an agreed set of institutions that can continue to develop—but a formalised political unsettlement" (Political Settlements Analysis, page 5)​(2).
Example:

The research has global relevance in contexts such as peacebuilding, international law, and conflict resolution. It also integrates multiple disciplines, such as legal studies, political science, and international relations.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt:

"We suggest that the formalised political unsettlement contains opportunities for inclusion that could be better understood and embraced" (Abstract, page 1)​(2).
Example:

Resilience: The study promotes adaptable governance structures capable of enduring protracted conflict, allowing societies to navigate through prolonged political instability while avoiding collapse.
These dimensions illustrate the broad and significant impact of the study, highlighting its relevance across multiple domains and its potential for influencing long-term conflict resolution strategies.
