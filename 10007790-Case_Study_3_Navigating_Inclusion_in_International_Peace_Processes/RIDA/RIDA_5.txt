Here is a detailed analysis of the "Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions" for the study "Women, Peace Negotiations, and Peace Agreements" from the provided paper:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Peace processes involving the negotiation of formal peace agreements... have significant capacity to affect women's lives" (Women, Peace Negotiations, and Peace Agreements, page 418).
"Only 18% of peace agreements mention women" (Women, Peace Negotiations, and Peace Agreements, page 415). Example: The research contributes to the policy domain by highlighting the systemic underrepresentation of women in peace negotiations, influencing future policies on inclusivity and gender representation in conflict resolution​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Since 2000, there has been a clear international legal framework underwriting the inclusion of women in peace negotiations" (page 419). Example: This research will have a long-term impact as it supports international resolutions, such as CEDAW and UNSCR 1325, which have the potential to influence gender inclusivity in peace negotiations over decades​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Women in the middle of peace processes need information... and capacity to craft alternative drafts" (page 427). Example: Direct stakeholders include women in peace negotiations, policymakers, and gender advocacy groups. Indirectly, it benefits the general public by supporting more inclusive governance systems that lead to sustainable peace​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"A range of obstacles persist for women seeking to influence peace processes" (page 418). Example: The research has a broad impact, influencing not only gender studies but also peacebuilding, international law, and public policy sectors. Its recommendations apply globally to various post-conflict societies​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Peace processes in nearly 100 jurisdictions" (page 418). Example: The recommendations can be scaled and applied to peace processes globally, with the potential for transferability across different post-conflict settings, especially in developing countries with similar challenges​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"Representation does not equate with influence" (page 419). Example: This research challenges traditional approaches to peace negotiations by advocating for a disruptive innovation in the form of increased female representation, shifting the paradigm of peacebuilding from elite male-dominated processes to more inclusive frameworks​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Women often argue for inclusion because they feel their experience of conflict brings wider insights into ending it" (page 427). Example: The study aligns with ethical considerations by advocating for gender equity in peace processes. It also promotes sustainable peace, as inclusive peace processes are more likely to result in long-term stability​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Women need information from other processes, technical advice, and capacity to craft alternative drafts" (page 427). Example: The findings provide usable frameworks for international organizations, governments, and NGOs to implement gender-sensitive approaches in peace negotiations​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The UN has taken an interest in the presence of women in peace negotiations" (page 419). Example: The research is globally relevant, informing international organizations such as the United Nations, and has cross-disciplinary significance by impacting fields like gender studies, international law, and peace and conflict studies​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Women have an interest in ceasefire agreements and pathways forward" (page 420). Example: The study emphasizes the resilience of women in negotiating peace, advocating for adaptable peace frameworks that allow women's voices to shape governance and future policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
This detailed assessment aligns with the dimensions outlined in the study. Each dimension highlights how the research impacts peace negotiations, gender equality, and policy implementation.
