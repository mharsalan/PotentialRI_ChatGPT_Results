Based on the document "Evaluating Peace Agreements for their Gender Perspective," I have assessed the research impact across the 10 key dimensions of Research Impact (RI):

Domains of Research Impact:

Excerpt: "Peace processes often exclude women, despite them promoting peace initiatives throughout conflicts. Once formal peace talks begin, women are frequently left out, which limits the change agenda." (Introduction, page 6).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 6.
Example: This research impacts the Policy Domain by highlighting how peace agreements and negotiations can be restructured to include gender perspectives, influencing the inclusion of women in future international peace processes.
Duration of Research Impact:

Excerpt: "Women’s participation in peace agreements has increased since UNSC 1325; however, gender perspectives remain inconsistently implemented." (Executive Summary, page 3).
Page Reference and Section: Executive Summary, page 3.
Example: The impact is long-term, as the research forms part of ongoing efforts to improve gender inclusion in peace agreements over the last two decades, showing how incremental progress is made in international policy.
Stakeholder of Research Impact:

Excerpt: "Research indicates women’s underrepresentation in peace processes and agreements, translating into provisions that do not address women’s perspectives." (Results, page 4).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 4.
Example: Direct stakeholders include policymakers and peace negotiators, while indirect stakeholders are women and communities affected by the implementation of peace agreements without gender-inclusive provisions.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpt: "Agreements such as the Great Lakes regional accords offer extensive references to women, showcasing progress." (Summary, page 13).
Page Reference and Section: Summary, page 13.
Example: This research provides deep impact within peace negotiations, by addressing how gender perspectives can significantly reshape agreements, while also having broad impact by applying these insights across multiple international conflicts.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpt: "Where new institutions are established and gender equality is not included, international actors should support initiatives to ensure gender equality is considered." (Recommendations, page 3).
Page Reference and Section: Recommendations, page 3.
Example: This research is transferable, as its recommendations for gender inclusivity in peace agreements can be adapted for various conflict situations globally, and its impact could scale up with greater international support.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpt: "It might be useful to pursue ‘multiple pathways to peace’, beyond formal peace negotiations, to respond to broader civic needs." (Results, page 6).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 6.
Example: The proposal of multiple peace pathways introduces an innovative approach to peacebuilding, disrupting the traditional reliance on formal, elite-led negotiations.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpt: "Provisions for gender equality in agreements are essential to sustain long-term peace." (Results, page 6).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 6.
Example: The research promotes sustainable peace agreements by embedding gender equality, ensuring that post-conflict reconstruction efforts are ethical and inclusive.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpt: "Robust monitoring of peace agreements and enforcement of provisions for women is necessary." (Recommendations, page 3).
Page Reference and Section: Recommendations, page 3.
Example: Usability is high, as the research offers actionable steps for international organizations to implement gender-sensitive monitoring processes in peace agreements.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpt: "International peace agreements referencing women and gender have increased, particularly in processes involving the UN." (Summary, page 13).
Page Reference and Section: Summary, page 13.
Example: This research has global relevance, as it highlights how peace agreements worldwide have evolved under UNSC resolutions, bridging policy and gender studies.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpt: "The inclusion of women in peace processes and agreements continues to be inconsistent, despite improvements." (Results, page 4).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 4.
Example: This research shows resilience in advocating for gender perspectives over decades of peacebuilding, adapting as new UNSC resolutions and peace processes evolve.
These dimensions reflect the wide-ranging impact of the research on gender perspectives in peace agreements across multiple fields and global contexts.
