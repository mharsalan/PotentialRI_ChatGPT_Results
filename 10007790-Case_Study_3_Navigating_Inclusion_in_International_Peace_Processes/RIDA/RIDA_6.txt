Based on the study in the attached PDF file and the framework provided for the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is a detailed mapping of the research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research explores the relationship between political transitions from conflict and human rights, contributing to the fields of peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and policy development. It specifically addresses how human rights commitments intersect with political peace agreements to foster inclusive political settlements.
Page Reference: (Introduction, page 5)​(6).
Example: This study impacts the policy domain by informing efforts to improve political transitions and the incorporation of human rights in fragile states. It also touches on the social domain by addressing inclusion in political settlements, thus contributing to broader social transformation efforts in post-conflict regions.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The report emphasizes long-term and non-linear processes of peacebuilding, suggesting that peace agreements are not final solutions but require ongoing renegotiation and adjustment over time to maintain stability and inclusion.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 52-53)​(6).
Example: The long-term impact of this research will likely shape future peace processes, providing frameworks for ongoing political and social inclusion, as well as human rights enforcement across decades of post-conflict recovery.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research primarily targets policymakers, international organizations, and peacebuilders involved in mediating political transitions in conflict-affected states. It also considers marginalized groups as critical stakeholders in ensuring social inclusion in peace processes.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 60)​(6).
Example: Direct stakeholders include international bodies such as the United Nations or peace negotiation teams. Indirect stakeholders include local communities in conflict zones who benefit from more inclusive peace settlements, especially those marginalized in earlier processes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study advocates for horizontal elite inclusion and vertical social inclusion, impacting the depth of policy change at the elite level while encouraging broader social inclusion.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 52)​(6).
Example: The research has a deep impact within the field of peacebuilding by rethinking the balance between elite and broader societal inclusion. At the same time, it has broad implications across international peacebuilding efforts by addressing both the macro-level elite negotiations and the micro-level social dynamics.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The strategies recommended in the report, such as joint analysis across international actors and continuous support for post-agreement processes, can be scaled from individual peace agreements to broader international frameworks for peacebuilding.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 60)​(6).
Example: The research provides scalability for international peace processes, offering models that can be adapted to different conflict zones globally. Additionally, its frameworks are transferable to other contexts involving human rights and governance reforms.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The report challenges traditional approaches to peacebuilding by promoting new forms of inclusivity, such as the integration of local actors into international peace processes and hybrid models of governance.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 22)​(6).
Example: The disruptive potential lies in the report's advocacy for hybrid political orders that blend local practices with international peace standards, moving away from purely top-down approaches.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research emphasizes the ethical need for inclusion and human rights as central to sustainable peace processes, particularly the need for continuous engagement with marginalized communities.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 61)​(6).
Example: The research contributes to sustainability by promoting inclusive settlements that reduce the likelihood of conflict recurrence. It also aligns with ethical considerations by ensuring that all stakeholders, including marginalized groups, have a voice in the political process.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research provides concrete recommendations for international actors to adapt their peacebuilding strategies by focusing on horizontal and vertical inclusion, thus offering practical guidelines for policy adjustments.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 60)​(6).
Example: The usability of this research is high for international organizations involved in peace processes, as it provides clear frameworks for adapting peace agreements to different contexts with minimal bureaucracy.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The report addresses global challenges related to peacebuilding, human rights, and governance, integrating insights from political science, law, and conflict resolution studies.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 22)​(6).
Example: This research is globally relevant, offering insights that can be applied in different regions facing similar issues, from conflict zones in Africa to political transitions in Eastern Europe. Its cross-disciplinary nature bridges peacebuilding and human rights law.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The report argues for the importance of flexible, adaptable peacebuilding processes that can respond to changing dynamics over time, ensuring long-term stability and resilience in political settlements.
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 52-53)​(6).
Example: The research promotes resilience by advocating for adaptive governance models that can evolve in response to new political challenges, helping peace processes remain robust in the face of new conflicts or social tensions.
This framework captures the research's impact across the top 10 dimensions, showing its relevance to multiple domains, scalability, and potential for long-term influence.
