Based on a comprehensive analysis of the study "Navigating Inclusion in Transitions from Conflict: The Formalised Political Unsettlement," here are the most relevant potential research impacts organized by type, aligning with the dimensions of research impact:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to academic theory and knowledge: The concept of "formalized political unsettlement" advances theoretical discourse in political science, conflict resolution, and peace studies, particularly in relation to governance structures in post-conflict societies​(2).
Cross-disciplinary relevance: The study integrates legal, sociological, and political perspectives, making it relevant to interdisciplinary research. This could stimulate further research across multiple academic domains like international law, conflict resolution, and political theory​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influence on peacebuilding policies: The study offers insights that are critical for policymakers involved in peace negotiations. It suggests frameworks that can be adopted for inclusive peace settlements, impacting international relations and governmental policies​(Common Research Impact …)​(2).
Impact on international aid strategies: Aid organizations can use these findings to shape interventions in fragile states, ensuring that inclusivity is prioritized in political settlements. This could lead to more sustainable, inclusive political frameworks being adopted globally​(2)​(impact pathway).
3. Social and Cultural Impact
Promotion of societal inclusivity: The focus on both elite and societal inclusion can help transform how fragile states approach governance, potentially shifting social structures toward more equitable, inclusive practices​(2)​(Research impact toolkit).
Cultural shift in conflict resolution: By normalizing ongoing negotiation within political structures, this research can contribute to a long-term shift in how societies manage and address conflict, promoting reconciliation and reducing social tensions​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Economic Impact
Indirect economic benefits: Although not directly aimed at economic outcomes, the study’s potential to stabilize conflict regions could foster environments conducive to economic growth, reducing the financial burdens of protracted conflicts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Reduction in conflict-related health issues: By promoting sustainable governance and reducing the risk of renewed conflict, the study indirectly contributes to improving public health outcomes in conflict-affected areas. It could help reduce the healthcare strain typically associated with political unrest​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Environmental Impact
Sustainability in post-conflict governance: While not directly focused on environmental issues, the frameworks suggested could contribute to sustainable governance systems that also prioritize environmental policies as part of inclusive political settlements​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Technological and Practical Impact
Innovative frameworks for peacebuilding: The study’s approach to the "formalized political unsettlement" provides innovative pathways for practitioners in conflict resolution, setting new benchmarks in peace negotiations that could disrupt traditional peace processes​(Common Research Impact …).
Transferable models for conflict management: The frameworks discussed could be applied to other conflict regions beyond those studied, such as areas facing social unrest or political instability, offering tools to manage transitions more effectively​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Ethical governance: The study emphasizes the importance of inclusivity, which aligns with broader ethical goals of equity and fairness in governance. This is crucial in post-conflict settings where power dynamics are often skewed, and the legal frameworks suggested could institutionalize these ethical considerations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Legal impact on institutional design: The study’s suggestions for institutional frameworks in fragile states may inform new legal structures that ensure continuous negotiation and conflict resolution, contributing to global legal discourses on peace agreements​(2)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilient governance structures: The study promotes governance models that are adaptable to continuous conflict, enhancing the resilience of political structures in fragile states. This adaptability can ensure that governance remains functional even under challenging conditions​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Long-term adaptability of peace agreements: The notion of political settlements that are not static but continuously negotiated ensures that post-conflict regions can adapt to new challenges over time​(2).
10. Public Awareness and Education
Raising awareness on inclusive peace processes: The research can raise awareness among the public, NGOs, and educational institutions about the importance of inclusivity in peace processes, influencing public opinion and potentially fostering grassroots support for such initiatives​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Capacity Building and Training
Training for peace negotiators and policymakers: The insights from this study could be incorporated into training programs for policymakers, international diplomats, and peace negotiators, enhancing their capacity to create more inclusive and resilient peace agreements​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Implementation and Usability
Application in real-world conflict zones: The findings offer usable frameworks for practitioners in international organizations, NGOs, and governments, making it possible to implement more inclusive and adaptable peace processes in real-world settings​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts show the study's far-reaching potential to influence not only academic discourse but also practical policy, social structures, and global peace initiatives. It positions itself as a key contribution to conflict resolution theory, legal frameworks for governance, and ethical considerations in post-conflict reconstruction.
