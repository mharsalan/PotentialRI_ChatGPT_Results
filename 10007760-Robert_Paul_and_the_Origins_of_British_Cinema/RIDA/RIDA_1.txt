Based on your request, I have evaluated the research document uploaded for its research impact across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact." Here's a breakdown of each dimension as it applies to the study:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The study impacts multiple domains such as the technological, cultural, and business sectors, especially through its focus on filmmaking technologies and early cinema's commercial potential. The innovations discussed had technological implications in animation and advertising, as well as cultural influences in preserving individual movements and performances for the public​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 268.
Example: The impact of the study reaches the technological domain through the development of animated advertisements and early cinema devices. This, in turn, affected the cultural domain by creating portable animated portraits and influencing public access to moving images.
Duration of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The long-term impact is noted through advancements in the manufacturing and sale of animatographs and accessories, which contributed to ongoing innovations in cinema technology​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 268.
Example: The production of animated photographs had a lasting impact by laying foundational technologies that later expanded into modern filmmaking and advertising, influencing both short- and long-term commercial practices.
Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpt: The key stakeholders identified include industrial manufacturers, advertisers, and filmmakers. The text notes that "several prominent advertisers are negotiating for such advertisements on extremely remunerative terms," suggesting commercial entities' interest in the innovations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 269.
Example: The stakeholders benefiting from this research include businesses seeking innovative advertising methods, manufacturers of animatograph technology, and the general public, which gained access to animated portraits and advertisements.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpt: The research had both deep and broad impacts. Deep impact is reflected in technological advancements specific to the development of animatographs, while broad impact occurred across cultural sectors, influencing public exhibitions and personal portraiture​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 269.
Example: While the deep impact focused on refining technology within a niche (early cinema devices), the breadth extended to societal changes, such as how the public interacted with moving images in advertisements and personal portraits.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpt: The research’s scalability is seen in its potential to be used by both professional filmmakers and amateurs. The text suggests that an "instrument cheaper and simpler than that required for public entertainments" would make these innovations more accessible​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 268.
Example: The scalability of this research was realized through the broader availability of animatographs, enabling amateurs and smaller-scale productions to engage with the new technology.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpt: The study introduced significant innovations, especially in advertising. It describes animated advertisements as a "striking result" with potential to supersede illuminated devices, thus disrupting traditional advertising methods​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 269.
Example: This research had disruptive potential in the advertising industry by creating a new form of animated advertisements, likely altering the way businesses approached marketing and public engagement.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpt: Ethical considerations are implicit in the idea of providing "animated portraits of individuals" at a low cost, preserving "natural movements" for personal and historical records​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 268.
Example: The research promoted sustainability in terms of cultural heritage, ensuring that personal and historical records could be preserved through innovative technologies at an affordable rate.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpt: The usability is reflected in the text's focus on making the technology accessible to amateurs. "An important extension of business will probably result from the supply to amateurs" suggests the focus on user-friendly and scalable technologies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 268.
Example: The implementation potential was high because the technology was designed for both public entertainment and individual use, making it accessible for various applications in different sectors.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpt: The cross-disciplinary relevance is highlighted through the technology’s application in both advertising and filmmaking. The text mentions animated portraits and advertisements as significant innovations with widespread appeal across industries​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 269.
Example: The innovations transcended filmmaking, influencing advertising techniques globally, demonstrating the global relevance of the study’s findings.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpt: The adaptability of the research is shown through its potential to evolve with industry needs. The study’s innovations were not static; the development of animated advertisements and personal portraits could adapt to various contexts and applications over time​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference and Section: Appendix B, page 269.
Example: The technology demonstrated resilience by remaining relevant in different sectors, from commercial advertising to cultural preservation, and adapted to the needs of both professionals and amateurs.
This detailed breakdown connects the study to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," highlighting its contribution across various domains, stakeholders, and timescales.
