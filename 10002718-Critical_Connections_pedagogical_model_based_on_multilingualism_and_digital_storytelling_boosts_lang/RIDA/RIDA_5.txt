3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Teachers and educators benefit directly from the pedagogical frameworks introduced in the study, enabling them to implement MDST in multilingual classrooms. Students are also direct stakeholders as the approach empowers them to develop language skills and self-expression through digital storytelling​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: Educational policymakers and multilingual communities benefit indirectly by integrating the study’s recommendations into broader language policies, promoting inclusive practices that cater to linguistic diversity​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study provides a transformative approach to language learning, deeply influencing language education pedagogy, particularly in multilingual and intercultural contexts​(5).
Broad Impact: Its broad impact extends across fields such as education, sociology, and digital media, offering insights that can be applied in other sectors like community engagement and social integration through technology​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The MDST model is scalable across various educational settings, from primary schools to higher education institutions. The approach can be adopted by schools globally, particularly in multilingual societies dealing with migration and linguistic diversity​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
Transferability: The methodologies and tools (e.g., VoiceThread, film festivals, digital storytelling platforms) developed in this study can be transferred to other disciplines such as media studies, cultural studies, and even healthcare, where digital storytelling can be used for patient narratives​(5).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces innovative pedagogical methods by integrating digital storytelling and multiliteracies in language education, emphasizing learner agency, creativity, and multilingual communication​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
Disruption: It disrupts traditional monolingual, print-based approaches to language learning by promoting a dynamic, interactive, and digital approach that better aligns with 21st-century learning environments​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: By promoting the preservation and use of heritage languages, the study contributes to cultural and linguistic sustainability. It ensures that minority languages are maintained and valued within educational settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The research is ethically grounded in social justice, challenging coercive power relations within education and promoting equity by valuing all languages and cultural identities​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The MDST framework is highly implementable, with practical recommendations for teachers, including task-based learning, collaborative projects, and the use of digital platforms. The project has already been implemented in schools across multiple countries​(5).
Usability: The digital storytelling approach is adaptable to various classroom contexts, making it highly usable for teachers who aim to foster creative and critical thinking in students​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research crosses into fields like digital media, educational technology, and cultural studies, influencing how digital tools are used to foster literacy and language learning across disciplines​(5).
Global Relevance: The study’s framework is globally relevant, particularly for schools and communities dealing with migration and linguistic diversity. It offers a model for integrating digital storytelling to promote multilingual education in any cultural or geographic context​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study's approach is adaptable to the evolving technological landscape, ensuring that as digital tools advance, the framework remains relevant and can be updated to include newer platforms and storytelling techniques​(5).
Adaptability: The model is flexible, allowing teachers to tailor it to the specific linguistic and cultural contexts of their students. This adaptability ensures the longevity of the study’s impact in various educational settings​(5).
In conclusion, the research on multilingual digital storytelling (MDST) demonstrates significant potential across multiple dimensions of research impact, particularly in education, culture, and digital media. It offers scalable, innovative, and adaptable solutions for addressing linguistic diversity in schools and beyond, with long-term implications for policy, pedagogy, and social inclusion​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
