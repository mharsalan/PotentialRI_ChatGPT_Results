Based on the research provided in the document and aligning it with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is a detailed analysis of the study on "Rethinking Multilingualism: Trajectories in Policy, Pedagogy, and Research in the UK" by Anderson and Macleroy (2014):

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study examines the movement and changes in populations across the British Isles, leading to an increase in the number of languages spoken (over 300) and the challenge this presents to educators in fostering multilingualism and active citizenship.
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: The research significantly impacts the educational domain by addressing how educational systems can incorporate multilingualism, contributing to the development of inclusive and diverse pedagogical practices in the UK, fostering broader social integration.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The research sheds light on the evolving classroom dynamics as people move across countries and borders, shaping future studies in multilingual education."
Page Reference: Results, page 2.
Example: The study has long-term implications by laying a foundation for future research on multilingualism in education, as it adapts to ongoing changes in population and cultural diversity, ensuring that educational frameworks remain relevant for future generations.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "Educators face the challenge of supporting multilingualism in classrooms where English tends to dominate, often marginalizing other dialects, creoles, and vernaculars."
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: Key stakeholders include educators, policymakers, and students. The research provides valuable insights for educators in adopting inclusive pedagogies, for policymakers in creating supportive language policies, and for students who benefit from a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The research explores the increasing importance of acknowledging linguistic diversity in education, which goes beyond traditional monolingual approaches and recognizes the fluidity of languages."
Page Reference: Results, page 3.
Example: This research has a deep impact within the field of educational linguistics by challenging traditional monolingual education models. Its broad impact spans across policy-making, social integration, and pedagogy by promoting multilingualism as a tool for societal cohesion.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The implications of this research extend beyond the UK, as classrooms globally are experiencing similar shifts in linguistic diversity due to migration."
Page Reference: Discussion, page 4.
Example: The studyâ€™s findings on multilingual education are highly transferable and scalable to other countries facing similar linguistic challenges. The frameworks developed could be applied to other multicultural societies to enhance language policies and educational practices.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "Barton argues that dominant languages such as English support monolingualism, which ignores linguistic diversity, a notion this research seeks to challenge."
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: This research has disruptive potential by advocating for a shift from monolingualism to multilingualism in educational settings. It challenges existing norms by proposing new approaches that embrace linguistic diversity as a resource rather than a challenge.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The study emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in promoting active citizenship through inclusive language policies that respect linguistic diversity."
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The research promotes social sustainability by advocating for inclusive language policies that align with ethical principles of fairness and equity, ensuring that all linguistic groups have equal opportunities in educational systems.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The study provides practical recommendations for educators on how to integrate multilingualism into classroom practices."
Page Reference: Results, page 3.
Example: The practical recommendations for integrating multilingualism into educational curricula make this research highly usable for educators, who can apply these strategies to create more inclusive classrooms. This usability enhances the immediate impact on educational practices.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "This research contributes to global discussions on superdiversity, which is a worldwide phenomenon as countries become more multicultural."
Page Reference: Results, page 4.
Example: The research is globally relevant as it addresses the cross-disciplinary issue of multilingualism in education, intersecting with sociology, linguistics, and public policy. The findings contribute to global discussions on education in multicultural societies, making it applicable worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "As classroom dynamics continue to evolve with increased linguistic diversity, this research adapts to the needs of modern, multicultural societies."
Page Reference: Discussion, page 6.
Example: The adaptability of this research ensures its continued relevance, as it responds to ongoing changes in population demographics and linguistic diversity. It can evolve to inform future studies on how educational systems should adapt to these shifts.
This detailed analysis demonstrates how the study's focus on multilingualism impacts various research dimensions, influencing educational practices, policy-making, and social integration both in the UK and globally.
