The study "Translanguaging through the lens of drama and digital storytelling: shaping new language pedagogies in the classroom" by Sotiroula Stavrou, Chryso Charalambous, and Vicky Macleroy presents several research impact dimensions as per the predefined instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions for this study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Educational Domain: The study primarily impacts the educational domain by advancing pedagogical methods, introducing drama and digital storytelling as innovative tools for language teaching, and promoting translanguaging to foster multilingualism in classrooms. It challenges traditional monolingual approaches and encourages bidialectalism by integrating Cypriot Greek (CG) and Standard Modern Greek (SMG) in education​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Social Domain: The research contributes to social justice by validating multilingualism in educational settings and promoting empathy through storytelling, especially by addressing the theme of migration and belonging, as highlighted in the digital story Irene – A refugee's story. This socially oriented focus encourages children to engage with critical societal issues like migration and empathy for refugees​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Cultural Domain: The study contributes to cultural preservation by promoting the use of Cypriot Greek, a dialect often marginalized in formal education. It enhances students' cultural identity and linguistic agency by encouraging the use of both formal and informal language varieties through translanguaging​(6).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: In the immediate term, the research helps educators integrate drama and digital storytelling into their language teaching practices, offering them tools to create more engaging and culturally relevant lessons​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research has the potential to influence curriculum reforms that promote the use of translanguaging and creative pedagogies in multilingual classrooms globally. Its contributions to critical literacy and language awareness are foundational for future research on educational equity​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Teachers, students, and educational policymakers are the direct stakeholders. Teachers benefit from new pedagogical tools, while students, especially those from multilingual backgrounds, gain a platform for expressing their identities. Policymakers are informed by the study to promote inclusive language policies​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: Multilingual communities and cultural organizations indirectly benefit from the social and cultural validation the research provides. The study also contributes to societal understanding of migration and refugee experiences​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: Within the field of language pedagogy, the research deeply influences how educators approach multilingualism. It provides a model that redefines the role of dialects in formal education, advocating for the use of both CG and SMG in classrooms​(6).
Broad Impact: The research has broad implications beyond language education, influencing the fields of drama, digital storytelling, and social justice. It fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between education, drama, and cultural studies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The pedagogical model of integrating translanguaging with digital storytelling can be scaled to other educational contexts, both in Cyprus and internationally. It can be adapted to other bilingual or multilingual settings to promote language equity and cultural inclusion​(6).
Transferability: The framework developed in this research can be transferred to other disciplines, such as media studies or social work, where storytelling and critical reflection play key roles in education and social intervention​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces an innovative combination of drama, digital storytelling, and translanguaging in language education. It offers new ways of engaging students, enhancing both language skills and critical thinking​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: The research disrupts traditional language education models by challenging the dominance of standard languages and advocating for the inclusion of dialects and informal language practices in formal education. This paradigm shift has the potential to transform how language is taught in multilingual settings​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes the sustainability of minority languages and dialects by integrating them into educational systems. This has long-term implications for cultural preservation and linguistic diversity​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The research is grounded in principles of social justice and equity, advocating for the inclusion of marginalized languages and empowering students from diverse linguistic backgrounds. It challenges linguistic hierarchies and fosters more inclusive educational practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research offers practical, actionable strategies for teachers, including specific examples of how to integrate drama and digital storytelling into language lessons. It also provides guidance on fostering critical language awareness through translanguaging​(6).
Usability: The digital storytelling framework is highly usable and adaptable to different classroom contexts, making it accessible for educators worldwide​(6).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research crosses multiple disciplines, including education, drama, linguistics, and digital media. Its emphasis on social justice and empathy also makes it relevant to fields such as sociology and human rights education​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: Although focused on Cyprus, the study has global relevance, particularly in regions with significant linguistic diversity. Its findings can be applied in multilingual educational contexts across the world​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study's approach is resilient to changing educational environments as it promotes flexible, creative methodologies that can adapt to new linguistic and technological developments​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Adaptability: The model can easily be adapted to different cultural and linguistic contexts, making it relevant for educators working in diverse educational settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
In summary, this study provides significant contributions to educational theory and practice, particularly in multilingual contexts. It combines innovative pedagogical strategies with a strong ethical foundation, making it scalable, transferable, and adaptable across various educational and cultural settings. The research holds both deep and broad impacts, influencing not only language pedagogy but also promoting social justice and cultural preservation​(6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
