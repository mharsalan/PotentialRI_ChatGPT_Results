The study “Creative and critical approaches to language learning and digital technology: findings from a multilingual digital storytelling project” by Jim Anderson, Yu-Chiao Chung, and Vicky Macleroy holds significant potential for research impacts across a range of dimensions, both before and after publication. Below is a detailed account of the research impact pathways designed to achieve these potential impacts.

1. Pre-publication Pathways
The pre-publication phase involves actions that lay the groundwork for future impacts through stakeholder engagement, capacity building, and collaborative networks. These pathways aim to ensure the research resonates with both academic and non-academic audiences.

a. Stakeholder Engagement
Identifying Key Stakeholders: In this study, teachers, students, educational policymakers, and digital platform developers are the key stakeholders. Engaging them early through surveys, focus groups, and pilot projects ensures that the study is tailored to their practical needs and integrates real-world challenges in language learning and digital storytelling.
Involving Schools and Teachers: Teachers and school leaders play a pivotal role in shaping the research focus. By conducting fieldwork in multilingual schools in London and abroad, the researchers can gather input from educators, ensuring the study remains grounded in real classroom dynamics​(5).
b. Capacity Building and Training
Workshops and Training for Educators: Organize pre-publication workshops that introduce teachers to multilingual digital storytelling (MDST) tools. These workshops offer hands-on experience with platforms like VoiceThread and help build digital literacy among educators, encouraging them to adopt these methods in their teaching​(Research impact toolkit).
Incorporating MDST into Teacher Training Programs: Collaborating with teacher training institutions to introduce MDST frameworks to new educators ensures the research findings are adopted widely in classrooms, fostering a new generation of teachers proficient in integrating digital tools into language learning​(Research impact toolkit).
c. Establishing Networks and Partnerships
Academic Collaborations: Building cross-institutional and international collaborations with universities, research centers, and educational bodies expands the study’s reach. For example, partnerships with institutions in Taiwan, Algeria, and Palestine as outlined in the study enhance its global applicability and scalability​(5)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Engaging with Digital Platform Developers: Collaborating with developers of digital storytelling platforms ensures the research findings are integrated into future iterations of these tools, making them more tailored to educational needs​(impact pathway).
2. Pathways During Publication
At the publication stage, the research’s dissemination and communication strategies are critical to achieving wide-reaching impacts across academic, social, and policy domains.

a. Academic Dissemination
Open Access Publishing: Publishing the study in open-access journals allows teachers, educational policymakers, and researchers without institutional access to apply its findings. This broadens the reach of the research to under-resourced schools and educators who benefit most from innovative, low-cost digital tools​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Presenting at International Conferences: The findings should be presented at international conferences in fields such as educational technology, multilingual education, and digital literacy. Presenting at events like the British Educational Research Association (BERA) increases academic engagement and fosters further collaboration​(Research Impact Knowled…).
b. Public and Media Engagement
Media Outreach: Engaging with educational and cultural media outlets to discuss the potential of multilingual digital storytelling in enhancing language education. This could include articles in educational magazines, blog posts, podcasts, or interviews to raise awareness about the benefits of MDST​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Social Media and Webinars: Hosting webinars and creating digital content for platforms such as YouTube can expand the reach of the research to a global audience of educators and policymakers. Social media engagement also encourages the wider educational community to adopt and share MDST practices​(impact pathway).
3. Post-publication Pathways
After publication, the focus shifts to long-term implementation, policy influence, and monitoring impact to ensure sustained and scalable effects on education and society.

a. Implementation in Schools
Pilot Programs in Multilingual Schools: Partnering with multilingual schools to implement the MDST framework on a larger scale. The feedback from these pilot programs can be used to refine the approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse cultural and linguistic contexts​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Teacher Professional Development Programs: Rolling out nationwide teacher training initiatives based on the study’s findings ensures the methods reach more classrooms. These programs help educators integrate digital storytelling into their curriculum, fostering language learning through creative, student-centered approaches​(Research Impact Knowled…).
b. Policy Influence
Advising Educational Policymakers: Presenting the research findings to local and national educational authorities can lead to the incorporation of MDST into national language curricula. By highlighting its role in promoting multilingualism and digital literacy, the research can shape policies on inclusive education​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Collaboration with NGOs and Cultural Bodies: Working with organizations that promote multilingualism and digital equity ensures that the research findings influence broader social policies aimed at reducing digital divides and promoting access to digital learning tools​(Research Impact Knowled…).
c. Monitoring and Feedback
Longitudinal Studies: Conduct follow-up studies to assess the long-term impact of MDST on student language proficiency, creative thinking, and digital literacy. These studies would provide empirical evidence of the method’s effectiveness and adaptability across various educational contexts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Ongoing Teacher Feedback: Establish a feedback loop with participating schools to monitor how teachers implement the MDST framework and its impact on student engagement and learning outcomes. This feedback helps refine the model for broader adoption​(impact pathway).
4. Long-term Impact and Legacy Building
To ensure the research has a lasting impact, long-term strategies focus on expanding its reach and maintaining its relevance as educational technologies evolve.

a. Creating Digital Learning Resources
Open Educational Resources (OERs): Developing open-access digital resources based on the MDST framework ensures that schools worldwide can adopt the model. These resources could include lesson plans, digital storytelling templates, and video tutorials, making it easy for educators to implement the study’s findings​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
b. Building a Global Community of Practice
Establishing a Network of Multilingual Educators: Form a community of practice that brings together educators, policymakers, and researchers who are interested in multilingual digital storytelling. This network would provide a platform for sharing experiences, best practices, and furthering research on MDST​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
c. Expanding International Collaborations
Global Scaling of the MDST Framework: Building on partnerships with schools in Algeria, Palestine, and Taiwan, the research can be scaled globally to other multilingual educational contexts. The lessons learned from international collaborations can enrich the framework and make it applicable across diverse linguistic and cultural environments​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conclusion
The research impact pathways for this study are designed to ensure the widespread adoption of multilingual digital storytelling as an innovative and inclusive approach to language learning. By engaging stakeholders early, disseminating findings widely, and implementing long-term monitoring strategies, the study can achieve deep and broad impacts across education, policy, and social domains​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
