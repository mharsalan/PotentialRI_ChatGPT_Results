Based on the study “Translanguaging through the lens of drama and digital storytelling: shaping new language pedagogies in the classroom” by Sotiroula Stavrou, Chryso Charalambous, and Vicky Macleroy, the potential research impacts can be summarized and detailed as follows, aligned with predefined instructions:

1. Educational Impact
Transformative Pedagogical Approaches: The study introduces translanguaging, drama, and digital storytelling as tools that transform traditional language teaching. By creating translanguaging spaces, the study allows students to use both Cypriot Greek (CG) and Standard Modern Greek (SMG), fostering critical thinking and creativity. This has the potential to change how languages are taught, especially in bidialectal or multilingual classrooms globally​(6).
Critical Literacy and Critical Language Awareness: The study highlights how integrating these creative practices leads to the development of critical literacy and language awareness among students. This could inspire new teacher training programs focused on incorporating creative pedagogical methods into the language curriculum​(6).
2. Social Impact
Promotion of Social Justice and Empathy: Through the project Irene – A refugee’s story, students engage with critical social issues such as migration and displacement. By exploring these themes, the study fosters empathy, which could lead to the broader adoption of socially conscious educational practices. It could also impact how social issues are introduced and discussed in classrooms​(6).
Empowerment of Marginalized Languages and Dialects: The use of Cypriot Greek, which is often marginalized in formal education, promotes linguistic diversity and inclusion. This contributes to ongoing efforts to preserve minority languages and integrate them into educational systems, potentially influencing language policies in similar contexts globally​(6).
3. Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation and Identity Formation: By validating students' use of Cypriot Greek alongside Standard Modern Greek, the study supports cultural identity formation in young learners. This has a broader cultural impact, as it promotes the preservation and celebration of linguistic diversity within educational settings, especially in regions with rich linguistic heritage​(6).
4. Policy Impact
Influence on Language Education Policies: The study's findings could influence education policymakers to adopt more inclusive language policies that support translanguaging and multilingual education. In contexts where minority dialects or languages are undervalued, this research could inform reforms that promote linguistic equity​(6).
Curriculum Development: The study demonstrates the practical application of transformative pedagogies in classrooms, which could lead to the integration of digital storytelling and drama into national curricula, particularly in language and literacy programs​(6).
5. Technological Impact
Digital Literacy Enhancement: The integration of digital storytelling helps develop students' digital literacy skills, equipping them with tools to navigate and create in a digital world. This aligns with global educational trends emphasizing the importance of digital competencies​(6).
Scalability of Digital Platforms in Education: The digital storytelling component can be easily scaled and transferred to other educational settings. By leveraging digital platforms, the study’s methodologies could influence how technology is incorporated into classrooms for language learning​(6).
6. Cognitive and Emotional Development
Critical Thinking and Cognitive Flexibility: The use of drama and storytelling encourages students to think critically about language and identity, pushing them to engage in higher-order thinking and creative problem-solving. This contributes to the development of cognitive flexibility in students, a key skill for the 21st century​(6).
Emotional Engagement and Well-being: By involving students in empathetic narratives such as Irene – A refugee’s story, the study promotes emotional engagement. This kind of engagement has been shown to improve students’ mental well-being, especially when they connect personally with the content they are creating​(6).
7. Long-term Social and Educational Impacts
Sustainability of Multilingual Practices: The promotion of translanguaging can sustain the practice of using multiple languages in education, helping to maintain linguistic diversity over the long term. This is particularly relevant in regions with complex linguistic landscapes, such as Cyprus​(6).
Broad Influence on Teaching Methodologies: The success of integrating translanguaging and digital storytelling could inspire new pedagogical frameworks that extend beyond language learning to other subjects. This could lead to a wider application of transformative pedagogies in diverse educational contexts​(6).
8. Cross-disciplinary Impact
Intersection of Arts and Education: The study bridges drama, language education, and digital media, showing the potential for cross-disciplinary approaches in education. This could influence other fields, such as media studies, sociology, and cultural studies, encouraging them to adopt similar creative methodologies​(6).
9. International Impact
Global Relevance: While the study is based in Cyprus, the issues it addresses—such as multilingualism, migration, and social justice—are globally relevant. The pedagogical approaches developed in this research can be adapted to other multilingual education systems, making the findings applicable on an international scale​(6).
Educational Models for Post-Conflict Societies: By exploring belonging and identity through the lens of migration, the study provides an educational model that can be applied in post-conflict societies where issues of displacement and identity are prevalent​(6).
Conclusion
The study offers extensive potential impacts across the educational, social, cultural, technological, and policy dimensions. Its innovative integration of drama, digital storytelling, and translanguaging not only enriches language pedagogy but also promotes social justice, cultural preservation, and digital literacy. These impacts are scalable, transferable, and adaptable to various educational contexts, making the research significant both locally and globally​(6).
