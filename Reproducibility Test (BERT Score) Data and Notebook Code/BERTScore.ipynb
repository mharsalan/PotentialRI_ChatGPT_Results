These advancements could be transferable to other industries beyond insurance, where complex IT systems are integral, leading to cross-sector technological impact.\\n\\n3. Social and Organizational Impact\\nOn a social level, the study addresses the organizational and communication dynamics between customers and suppliers in outsourced projects. The findings could foster better collaborative practices and team communication across distributed environments, leading to improved work environments and project success. These organizational improvements can lead to better alignment between business goals and IT deliverables, which directly affects employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction when projects are delivered on time and within scope.\\n\\nMoreover, the study highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement in RE processes. This insight can lead to organizational shifts where business analysts and end-users are more actively involved in requirements elicitation, leading to better alignment of business needs with technology solutions.\\n\\n4. Policy and Regulatory Impact\\nThe study’s findings have the potential to influence policy frameworks for IT project governance in outsourced environments. For example, the need for clearer guidelines on RE processes, contractual obligations, and performance metrics between clients and suppliers could inform new regulations for outsourcing agreements, especially in highly regulated industries like insurance and finance.\\n\\n5. Capacity Building and Educational Impact\\nGiven the detailed nature of the study, it can serve as a valuable teaching resource in universities and professional training programs. It offers real-world insights into large-scale IT projects, making it an excellent case for teaching project management, systems engineering, and requirements management. Training future project managers and software engineers with knowledge derived from this study can enhance industry capacity to manage complex outsourced projects effectively.\\n\\n6. Health and Well-being Impact\\nWhile the study focuses on IT and business, improved RE processes, as identified in the study, can indirectly contribute to the health and well-being of employees in IT-intensive sectors. Better project management practices can reduce workplace stress, mitigate project failure anxiety, and contribute to a better work-life balance for employees involved in large, outsourced IT projects.\\n\\n7. Environmental Impact\\nAlthough not directly addressed in the case study, improved efficiency in IT development can have environmental benefits by reducing the need for excessive computing resources and reducing project waste. Streamlined RE processes lead to fewer project iterations, which in turn can lower the carbon footprint of long development cycles that consume energy and resources unnecessarily.\\n\\n8. Innovation and Disruption Potential\\nBy identifying the key challenges in outsourced RE processes, this research opens the door for innovative solutions, such as the development of new RE tools that better handle distributed teams, enhance transparency, and facilitate real-time collaboration between customers and suppliers. Such innovations could disrupt traditional RE practices, pushing the industry towards more agile, adaptable, and resilient project methodologies.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe research described in this case study has multi-dimensional impacts across academic, economic, social, and technological domains. The improvement of RE processes in large, complex, outsourced IT environments can transform organizational efficiency, reduce costs, and inspire future research, while influencing policy, training, and technological innovation. It serves as an excellent model for understanding the complexities and demands of requirements engineering in modern IT systems development.'}\n",
