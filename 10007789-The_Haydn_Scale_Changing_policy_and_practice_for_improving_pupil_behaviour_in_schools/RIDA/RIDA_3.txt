Based on the provided research paper titled "Working to Improve Classroom Climate Using a Ten Point Scale and Focusing on the Development of the Classroom Management Skills of Individual Teachers" by Terry Haydn, I will analyze the research using the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Here’s how the research aligns with each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study addresses classroom climate, which directly impacts educational practices and student achievement. "The working atmosphere in the classroom is an important variable in the process of education, with several studies suggesting that classroom climate has a significant impact on student attainment" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: This research impacts the educational domain by enhancing understanding of classroom management and its effects on teaching outcomes. It also influences teacher education programs by integrating classroom climate management into training curriculums.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research has both immediate and long-term implications: "The use of the 10 point scale...offers one way of developing teachers’ skills in this area" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: In the short-term, teachers and student-teachers can quickly apply the scale in their classroom to improve climate. Long-term, the research provides a foundation for future studies on classroom management and could influence teacher training programs for years to come.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The scale encourages teachers, student teachers, school managers and school governors to reflect on the factors influencing the working atmosphere in the classroom" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: Direct stakeholders include teachers, student-teachers, and school administrators who will use this scale to assess and improve classroom climate. Indirect stakeholders are students, who benefit from a more conducive learning environment.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The paper describes the use of a 10 point scale for conceptualising the working atmosphere in the classroom... as a continuum between a climate which is ideally conducive to learning (level 10), to a level where learning is severely constrained by the poor behaviour of some pupils" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: The research has deep impact in the educational domain, particularly in classroom management, providing a new approach for conceptualizing and improving learning environments. The breadth extends to other countries facing similar classroom climate challenges, making the study broadly relevant.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The scale may be of use and interest to those involved in teaching and teacher education in other countries" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: The 10-point scale is scalable as it can be adopted by various schools and teacher training programs across the globe. It is also transferable to different educational contexts, allowing teachers in diverse regions to adapt the tool based on local classroom dynamics.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The use of the 10 point scale to develop their understanding of factors influencing classroom climate offers one way of developing teachers’ skills in this area" (Discussion, page 2357).

Example: This research introduces an innovative tool for improving classroom management, offering a systematic approach to understanding and controlling classroom climate. It has disruptive potential by challenging traditional methods of classroom management that often overlook teacher-specific factors.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The research outlined in this paper supports Elliott’s view...that the classroom management skills of individual teachers are one of the key determinants of classroom climate and good pupil behaviour" (Discussion, page 2357).

Example: The research promotes sustainable educational practices by focusing on the long-term development of teacher skills rather than quick fixes. This approach aligns with the ethical responsibility of ensuring equitable learning environments for all students.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The scale encourages teachers...to reflect on the factors influencing the working atmosphere in the classroom" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: The scale is highly usable and can be implemented directly into teacher training and professional development programs. Teachers can easily apply it in real-time classroom situations to assess and improve learning conditions.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Given that deficits in classroom climate and pupil behaviour are not limited to the UK, the scale may be of use and interest to those involved in teaching and teacher education in other countries" (Abstract, page 2351).

Example: The research has global relevance, particularly in educational systems worldwide. It can be adapted across cultures and contexts, making it a valuable tool in addressing classroom climate issues universally.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Teachers were not simply helpless victims of ‘the system,’ and could make a big difference to lesson climate and pupil behaviour" (Results, page 2356).

Example: The research fosters resilience in teachers by empowering them with strategies to control and improve classroom climate, despite external challenges. It is adaptable across different educational settings, allowing teachers to refine their classroom management skills over time.

These dimensions highlight the research's multi-faceted impact on educational theory and practice, with significant contributions to improving classroom environments globally.
