4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study has a deep impact on education, particularly in teaching strategies and classroom management techniques, and moderate breadth as it could influence broader educational policy discussions.
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 145. Example: This research provides a deep impact in the field of educational psychology by offering targeted strategies for teachers, but it also has broad implications for educational policymakers.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The classroom management strategies proposed could be scaled to other educational systems and transferred to various school environments globally (discussion, pages 145–146).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, pages 145–146. Example: The strategies for improving classroom climate could be scaled to different educational systems, from local schools to national education programs, and transferred to varying teaching environments worldwide.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

While the research does not introduce radical innovations, it disrupts traditional classroom management approaches by advocating for a more nuanced, student-centered model of behavior management (discussion, page 145).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 145. Example: The research introduces a disruptive approach to classroom management by shifting from rigid control methods to more flexible, engagement-focused strategies.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study promotes long-term sustainable classroom management practices that improve teacher well-being and student outcomes without resorting to punitive measures (discussion, page 145).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 145. Example: The research aligns with sustainability in education by proposing methods that foster positive teacher-student relationships over time, and it addresses ethical considerations by emphasizing non-punitive, inclusive classroom practices.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The strategies presented are practical and easily implementable by teachers with minimal additional training (discussion, page 145). This enhances usability in real-world classrooms.
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 145. Example: The research offers high usability because its classroom management strategies can be directly implemented by teachers, without the need for extensive retraining.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

Although focused on education, the research draws on insights from psychology and behavioral science, making it relevant to those fields as well (results, page 145).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 145. Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by integrating concepts from psychology, which enhances its utility in understanding broader student behavior. Its global relevance lies in its applicability to classrooms worldwide, irrespective of local educational policies.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research provides strategies adaptable to various classroom settings, including those with more challenging student behavior (methods, page 136).
Page Reference and Section: Methods, page 136. Example: The strategies are designed to be resilient and adaptable, enabling teachers to modify their approaches based on the dynamics of individual classrooms and changing educational environments.
