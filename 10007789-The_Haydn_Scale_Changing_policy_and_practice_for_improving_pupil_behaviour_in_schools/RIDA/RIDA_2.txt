Based on the study you provided, here's a detailed breakdown of how it fits into the top 10 research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The research focuses on understanding classroom climate and its influence on student learning outcomes, which is significant for the academic domain (educational research) and the social domain (influencing policies and practices in schools to manage pupil behavior).
Section: Introduction and discussion, page 31.
Example: The research impacts both the academic domain by contributing to educational theory on classroom management and the social domain by informing public and school policy on student behavior management​(2).
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The research explores long-term implications for educational policies and short-term effects on classroom management and teaching strategies.
Section: Discussion, page 58.
Example: Short-term impact includes immediate applications for teachers to manage classroom behavior. The long-term impact may include influencing educational policy on how to create conducive classroom environments over time​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt: Stakeholders include teachers, educational institutions, policymakers, and students, as the findings offer insights into classroom climate management and its effects on learning.
Section: Throughout the paper.
Example: Direct stakeholders are teachers and policymakers who can apply the findings to improve classroom climates, while indirect stakeholders include students and parents, who benefit from better learning environments​(2).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The study delves deeply into the issue of classroom management (depth) but also broadly addresses the social and policy implications of educational climates across various schools (breadth).
Section: Results, page 58.
Example: The deep impact of the study is within educational research, offering a nuanced understanding of classroom management. The broad impact spans across educational policy and social behavior management, affecting how schools globally might address classroom disruptions​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The insights on classroom behavior and climate can be scaled across different educational settings globally and transferred to policies focused on improving school environments.
Section: Conclusion, page 60.
Example: Scalability could involve implementing behavior management strategies across national educational systems, while transferability includes applying these findings to other countries facing similar educational challenges​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: The research introduces innovative approaches to analyzing classroom climate through teacher-focused scales, which contrasts with traditional student-focused methods.
Section: Methodology, page 32.
Example: The innovation lies in shifting the focus from student behavior to teacher perceptions, which could disrupt how classroom management is approached in education​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The study addresses the ethical dilemma of balancing inclusive education with the need to manage disruptive behaviors that impede learning for others.
Section: Discussion, page 59.
Example: The research promotes sustainable classroom environments that are inclusive but still prioritize the right of students to learn without disruption​(2).
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The scale developed for assessing classroom climate is directly usable by educators and can be implemented in teacher training programs.
Section: Methodology, page 40.
Example: Teachers can use this scale to monitor and improve their classroom management practices, enhancing the immediate usability of the research in everyday educational settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: Although focused on English schools, the study has potential relevance for educational systems globally, especially in managing pupil behavior in diverse classroom environments.
Section: Conclusion, page 63.
Example: The study’s findings are relevant across disciplines such as psychology (behavioral management) and education policy, and they apply to both national and international educational contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The study acknowledges the challenges teachers face in managing behavior and suggests strategies for building resilience in classroom management.
Section: Discussion, page 61.
Example: By providing adaptable strategies for dealing with various levels of classroom disruption, the research helps educators develop resilience in maintaining a positive learning environment under challenging conditions​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This detailed assessment of the study provides a clear overview of its potential research impact across these top 10 dimensions.
