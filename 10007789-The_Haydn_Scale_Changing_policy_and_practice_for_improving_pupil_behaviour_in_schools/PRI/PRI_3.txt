Based on the detailed reading of the study titled "Working to Improve Classroom Climate Using a Ten Point Scale and Focusing on the Development of the Classroom Management Skills of Individual Teachers" by Terry Haydn, I have identified several potential research impacts across multiple categories. These impacts align with common dimensions of research impact, as defined in the materials you provided and relevant research impact frameworks. Here are the potential research impacts, categorized accordingly:

1. Academic Impact
This study provides valuable insights into classroom management, a key topic in educational research.

Advancing Knowledge: The study introduces a new conceptual framework using a 10-point scale to assess classroom climate, contributing to the academic understanding of how classroom dynamics influence student outcomes.
Methodological Advancement: The practical application of the 10-point scale presents a new tool for educators and researchers to systematically assess and improve classroom environments. This method can be tested and refined in future research.
Cross-Disciplinary Influence: Although rooted in educational research, the findings could influence studies in psychology, teacher education, and sociology, particularly in understanding group dynamics and behavioral management in learning settings​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
2. Societal Impact
This research has direct implications for society, especially in improving educational outcomes.

Improving Educational Practices: By equipping teachers with a practical tool to manage classroom behavior, the study could lead to improved learning environments, which positively impacts student learning and well-being.
Addressing Teacher Professional Development: The study emphasizes the need for continuous professional development in classroom management, which can inform national teacher training programs.
Cultural Change in Schools: Implementing the scale may lead to a cultural shift in schools, where classroom climate becomes a central focus in school improvement strategies​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Stakeholder Impact
Teachers and Educational Institutions: Teachers directly benefit from improved strategies for managing classrooms. Educational institutions, particularly those involved in teacher training, can incorporate this research into their curricula.
Students: Indirectly, students benefit from better classroom climates, which are linked to improved academic performance and behavioral outcomes.
Policymakers and Educational Authorities: The findings could inform education policies, particularly regarding teacher certification and training programs aimed at managing classroom behavior more effectively​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Educational and Pedagogical Impact
Curriculum Development: The study can influence curriculum design in teacher training programs, encouraging the incorporation of classroom climate assessment as a critical skill.
Improving Classroom Management Practices: It provides a concrete tool for teachers to improve their classroom management, which could become a staple of professional development programs in education systems worldwide​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Student Well-being: A positive classroom climate has been linked to better emotional and psychological well-being among students. This study’s findings could contribute to improving overall student health by reducing stress and disruptive behaviors in classrooms​(impact pathway).
Teacher Well-being: Teachers with better classroom management skills tend to experience less stress and burnout. The research, by providing tools to improve these skills, contributes to the well-being of educators as well​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Policy and Educational Reform Impact
Influencing Policy on Teacher Training: Policymakers might adopt the 10-point scale as part of national guidelines or standards for evaluating and improving classroom climates in schools.
Guidance for Teacher Certification: The framework introduced in this research could be included in certification and evaluation criteria for teachers, ensuring that classroom management is prioritized​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Economic Impact
Reducing Teacher Turnover: By improving classroom climate and reducing teacher stress, the study could help reduce the economic costs associated with high teacher turnover, a significant issue in many educational systems.
Improved Student Outcomes: Better-managed classrooms lead to higher student performance, which has long-term economic benefits through improved educational attainment and workforce readiness​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
8. Behavioral Change
Teacher Behavior: The research promotes a shift in how teachers perceive and manage classroom behavior, moving from reactive to proactive strategies based on structured assessment.
Student Behavior: A focus on classroom climate helps mitigate disruptive behavior, fostering an environment conducive to learning. Over time, this could lead to a broader cultural change in how student behavior is managed in schools​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainable Educational Practices: The study promotes sustainable classroom management by encouraging ongoing teacher development rather than short-term solutions.
Ethical Classroom Management: It emphasizes the ethical responsibility of teachers to create inclusive, fair, and respectful learning environments, which aligns with broader social values of equity and inclusion​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Capacity Building and Training
Teacher Training: The research contributes to building capacity in educational systems by providing a framework that can be used in teacher development programs globally. It fosters skills that are crucial for classroom management, which can be disseminated through workshops and training programs​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
11. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application in Schools: The 10-point scale is highly implementable in real-world educational settings, allowing for immediate application in schools. Its ease of use makes it a valuable tool for teachers and administrators​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
12. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Relevance: The challenges of classroom management and climate are universal, making the findings applicable in diverse educational contexts worldwide. This cross-disciplinary relevance enhances the study's global impact, especially in countries where educational reforms focus on improving teacher effectiveness​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts demonstrate the multifaceted influence of the study across academic, social, policy, economic, and cultural domains. The research not only provides immediate benefits for teachers and students but also has long-term implications for educational reform and professional development globally.
