Based on the full analysis of the study and leveraging insights from the documents you provided on research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of the study concerning the Quaker Business Method (QBM) in business governance:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Impact: The study contributes significantly to interdisciplinary academic research, blending insights from theology, organizational theory, and corporate governance. It can lead to new theoretical models of decision-making based on consensus rather than hierarchy, impacting studies in management and ethics.
Business and Corporate Governance Impact: The application of QBM in modern businesses has the potential to revolutionize corporate governance structures by promoting more inclusive, consensus-driven decision-making processes, improving organizational effectiveness, and reducing hierarchical conflicts.
Social Impact: Implementing QBM can foster a more collaborative work environment, increasing employee satisfaction and engagement by promoting shared decision-making and reducing top-down managerial practices.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact: Immediate impact could be seen in small- to medium-sized organizations that adopt aspects of QBM, particularly in enhancing meeting efficiency and inclusivity. It could quickly influence corporate meeting practices.
Long-Term Impact: Over time, if widely adopted, QBM could shift standard corporate governance models globally, influencing how decisions are made at both executive and board levels. It may also inspire further research into the integration of spiritual and ethical frameworks in business.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Corporate leaders, managers, and organizational consultants who can directly apply QBM principles to improve governance and decision-making.
Indirect Stakeholders: Employees and shareholders who would benefit from more transparent, inclusive decision-making processes, and potentially broader societal stakeholders, as businesses that adopt QBM might have a more positive impact on corporate culture and ethics.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research offers deep insights within the fields of management theory, ethics, and corporate governance. By introducing non-hierarchical decision-making into modern management, it could change how future scholars and professionals approach organizational leadership.
Broad Impact: Beyond the business sector, QBM could be applied in non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and community decision-making bodies, thus impacting sectors beyond its initial scope.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The QBM method could be scaled from small teams and organizations to multinational corporations. Its principles could be integrated into various levels of decision-making, from daily team meetings to executive board decisions.
Transferability: The method is transferable across different sectors, including healthcare, education, government, and non-profit organizations. Its focus on inclusivity and consensus makes it adaptable to diverse organizational environments.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces an innovative framework for decision-making based on centuries-old Quaker traditions. It bridges the gap between spiritual and corporate decision-making models, promoting ethics and shared responsibility in a modern business context.
Disruption: If adopted on a large scale, QBM has the potential to disrupt traditional corporate governance structures, which typically rely on hierarchical decision-making and voting systems. It could introduce a new standard of ethical leadership and collective decision-making.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: QBM promotes ethical and transparent decision-making, which can contribute to long-term sustainability in business practices. Organizations adopting this method may demonstrate better corporate social responsibility and more sustainable business models.
Ethical Considerations: The method encourages fairness, accountability, and inclusivity, aligning with modern ethical standards in business and governance. It could lead to more socially responsible corporate behavior.
8. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application: The QBM method is practical and relatively easy to implement in various settings. Its principles can be incorporated into meeting structures with minimal disruption, particularly in settings that already value collaborative approaches.
Usability: Its ease of adaptation makes it useful for a wide range of organizations, particularly those seeking to enhance inclusivity and transparency in decision-making processes.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-Disciplinary Impact: The study's insights apply across multiple fields, including theology, ethics, business management, and organizational behavior. It has the potential to inspire interdisciplinary research and cross-sectoral applications in both academic and practical contexts.
Global Relevance: As decision-making is a universal challenge in organizations, QBM can have global relevance, particularly in multinational corporations, NGOs, and educational institutions looking to foster more collaborative governance structures.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The flexibility of QBM makes it highly resilient, especially as it can be adapted to both in-person and remote decision-making contexts. Its principles can withstand technological and organizational shifts, making it a sustainable decision-making model for the future.
Adaptability: QBM can be applied in various cultural and organizational contexts, including secular environments, while maintaining its core values of consensus and collaboration.
11. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Potential Influence on Corporate Policy: The study’s advocacy for inclusive decision-making could influence corporate policies, particularly in governance and ethics. Organizations may adopt QBM-inspired policies that promote transparency and collective responsibility.
Impact on Educational Policy: Educational institutions may adopt QBM as part of leadership training programs, thereby influencing future leaders and managers.
12. Public Awareness and Education
Awareness: The dissemination of the study’s findings could raise awareness about the importance of ethical decision-making and inclusivity in business governance. Public discussions on ethical leadership could be sparked by the study’s emphasis on shared governance models.
13. Cultural and Social Impact
Cultural Impact: By integrating spiritual practices into modern corporate governance, the study could foster a cultural shift toward more ethical and inclusive leadership practices, influencing broader societal norms around leadership and decision-making.
Social Impact: Widespread adoption of QBM could lead to more egalitarian decision-making structures in businesses and organizations, contributing to social change by challenging traditional power dynamics.
This study on QBM has the potential to generate wide-ranging impacts across multiple sectors, providing innovative, sustainable, and ethically grounded alternatives to conventional business and organizational governance methods.
