Based on the provided research paper and your guidelines for assessing research impact, here is an analysis of the study mapped across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study discusses the application of Quaker Business Method (QBM) in contemporary business meetings, suggesting its relevance to corporate governance. "The process that underpins a Meeting for Business in the manner of Friends has the potential to be transferable to contemporary business meetings, and may rapidly improve their inclusiveness and effectiveness." (Introduction, page 4).
Domains Impacted:
Academic: The research contributes to organizational studies by integrating the historical and theological perspectives of the Quaker decision-making process into modern management theories.
Business and Social Domains: By suggesting the integration of spiritual leadership into modern management, it influences corporate practices.
Example: This research can influence corporate governance models by promoting a participative, non-hierarchical decision-making framework, transforming boardroom practices.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "It seems apparent to me that further discernment (and indeed, research) is required to understand how QBM can improve decision-making in contemporary organizations, whether face-to-face or on-line" (Discussion, page 15).
Impact Duration:
Short-Term: Immediate application in smaller businesses or organizations looking to implement more collaborative practices.
Long-Term: Potential foundational work for long-term changes in organizational governance, particularly in developing a new paradigm for corporate decision-making processes.
Example: In the short term, small-scale organizations may adopt these practices, while the long-term impact could be seen in policy changes within larger corporations.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "QBM is perhaps the most interesting aspect of Friends’ broader approach to corporate governance... the theology and process by which Friends conduct Meetings for Business deserves renewed attention." (Page 4).
Stakeholders:
Direct: Organizational leaders, business managers, and academics studying corporate governance.
Indirect: Employees, customers, and shareholders who may benefit from more inclusive and thoughtful decision-making processes.
Example: Managers who integrate the Quaker method may see improved decision-making, and employees may experience a more inclusive work culture.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "QBM...is a unique process that can develop solidarity around a collective way forward." (Page 17).
Depth: Profoundly affects leadership and decision-making theory within organizational studies.
Breadth: Potential to influence broader societal shifts in leadership and decision-making, applicable across multiple industries and disciplines.
Example: The study's deep impact lies in reshaping organizational leadership models, while its broad implications extend to various sectors, including corporate governance, education, and social organizations.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "Contemporary businesses may find benefits in using at least some component parts of QBM, if not the entire process or the theology." (Discussion, page 17).
Scalability: The method can be scaled from small organizations to large corporations.
Transferability: It can be transferred to different sectors, such as healthcare, education, and public administration.
Example: Small businesses adopting QBM can scale the method across larger corporate structures or adapt it for public sector decision-making.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "QBM nurtures a culture of listening, enabling participants to achieve a shared understanding of complex situations." (Page 17).
Innovation: Introduces a non-hierarchical, collaborative decision-making model.
Disruption: Challenges traditional corporate governance models that rely on hierarchy and majority voting, potentially replacing them with consensus-driven processes.
Example: By adopting QBM, businesses might disrupt traditional hierarchical decision-making structures, leading to more democratic corporate environments.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "In an online article for Forbes... Quaker practices can help managers make better decisions." (Page 17).
Sustainability: Ethical decision-making processes that emphasize cooperation and fairness could lead to more sustainable business practices.
Ethical Considerations: The process encourages transparency and accountability, promoting decisions that are fair and just for all stakeholders.
Example: Businesses that adopt QBM might foster more ethically responsible corporate cultures, emphasizing long-term sustainability over short-term gains.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "I argue that the Quaker Business Method...has the potential to be transferable to modern management and organizational practice." (Page 4).
Usability: QBM can be implemented in various organizational settings with minimal structural changes, particularly in decision-making frameworks.
Implementation: The study suggests practical steps for adapting QBM, including the importance of mutual respect, active listening, and non-hierarchical decision-making.
Example: A company could adopt QBM by simply adjusting meeting structures, such as incorporating silent reflection periods and promoting consensus over voting.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "Ultimately, QBM...can be used by individuals and teams in organizations... even in secular contexts." (Page 17).
Cross-disciplinary: Integrates elements of theology, leadership studies, and organizational behavior.
Global Relevance: The study’s insights are applicable globally, especially in corporate settings, NGOs, and academic institutions.
Example: The QBM method could be adopted by international corporations, NGOs, or government agencies, promoting better decision-making processes globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The rapid emergence of remote or online decision-making practices in contemporary organizations raises particular issues for advocates of QBM." (Page 17).
Resilience: The method’s flexibility in adapting to online or remote meetings demonstrates its resilience.
Adaptability: It can be adapted to both in-person and virtual settings, maintaining its core principles while adjusting to new technologies.
Example: As remote work increases, businesses can adapt QBM to virtual platforms, ensuring consistent decision-making practices across various communication mediums.
This comprehensive impact assessment demonstrates how the study of QBM intersects multiple dimensions, from business to ethics and adaptability, making it a versatile and impactful research endeavor across several sectors.
