Based on the comprehensive content of the study and aligning it with predefined research impact dimensions and guidelines, here are the potential research impacts:

1. Academic Impact
The study has a clear academic contribution by advancing understanding in several disciplines, particularly history, media studies, and education. By making historical television archives available, it provides a critical resource for researchers exploring post-war European history, culture, and politics. It enhances academic discourse by offering new primary sources for analysis​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

2. Societal and Cultural Impact
The research contributes to societal change by enhancing the public’s understanding of historical and cultural issues through accessible media archives. This can influence public opinion and engage wider audiences in discussions about European history and identity. Additionally, the study promotes cultural preservation by safeguarding audiovisual records that reflect European social and political transformations​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

3. Educational Impact
The study plays a significant role in the educational domain, as the digitalization of archives allows educators to integrate rich audiovisual materials into their curriculum. This leads to more engaging teaching methodologies and enhances students' understanding of European post-war history through visual media​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

4. Environmental and Technological Impact
Though indirect, the digitization and preservation techniques used in the project may advance technological innovation in digital archiving and preservation, setting standards for how large-scale media archives are maintained for long-term use. This also has environmental benefits, as digital archives reduce the need for physical storage and the environmental costs associated with maintaining physical collections​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).

5. Economic Impact
While the study primarily focuses on cultural and academic outcomes, it may also have economic benefits through the creation of digital platforms that host these archives. These platforms could generate revenue through licensing agreements, collaborations with media companies, or educational institutions​(Research impact toolkit).

6. Health and Well-being Impact
The research supports the well-being of society by offering culturally rich, historical content that can foster a deeper understanding of identity, heritage, and collective memory, indirectly contributing to mental and emotional well-being by connecting people to their cultural roots​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research is highly cross-disciplinary, influencing not only history and media studies but also education, sociology, and cultural studies. The archives contain content of international relevance, documenting the social and political evolution of post-war Europe, which has global educational significance​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

8. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study introduces innovative methods in digital preservation and access to media archives. By disrupting traditional barriers to accessing historical media (i.e., physical archives), it democratizes information, allowing widespread access to previously unavailable television content, which can inspire similar approaches in other fields like radio and print media archives​(impact pathway).

9. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The ethical aspects of this research are significant, particularly in handling copyright issues associated with broadcasting materials. By addressing these ethical concerns, the project ensures sustainable access to archives without infringing on intellectual property rights​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

10. Implementation and Usability
The research findings are immediately usable by educators, researchers, and the public. The creation of user-friendly digital platforms ensures that the materials are accessible for various stakeholders, ranging from academic researchers to high school teachers looking to enrich their curriculum with historical television footage​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research impact toolkit).

11. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
The project adds to the body of knowledge in media studies, history, and digital archiving, serving as a foundational resource for future research. Its contribution to the field of historical media preservation supports ongoing advances in these areas​(Research Impact Knowled…).

12. Public Awareness and Engagement
By providing publicly accessible archives, the project enhances public awareness of European history, promoting an understanding of significant political and cultural milestones. This could lead to a more informed public discourse on historical events and their contemporary implications​(Research Impact Knowled…).

13. Equity and Inclusivity
The research promotes equitable access to historical resources, ensuring that materials are available to a wide audience, including students, historians, and the general public. This democratization of knowledge supports inclusivity by making previously restricted archives available to those who may not have had access before​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

14. Technological Adoption and Commercialization
The technological methods used in digitizing and archiving could be adopted by other media companies, universities, and libraries, leading to broader technological adoption in the field of digital humanities. This could also result in commercial opportunities through partnerships with tech firms specializing in archiving and preservation​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

15. Behavioral Change
By increasing access to historical archives, this research could influence behavioral changes in how people consume media and engage with history. It could foster a culture of using digital archives as primary sources for understanding and interpreting past events, shifting the public’s approach to historical research​(Common Research Impact …).

16. Policy Influence
The project could influence cultural policy, particularly around the preservation and accessibility of national broadcast archives. Governments and media organizations may adopt similar models for their archives, shaping future policy on media preservation and public access​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

These impacts cover a wide array of domains, demonstrating the multifaceted contributions of the study.
