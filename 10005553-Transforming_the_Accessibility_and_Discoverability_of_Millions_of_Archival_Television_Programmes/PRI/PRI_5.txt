After reading the entire study and analyzing it using the framework of potential research impacts, here are several specific impacts that align with common research impact dimensions:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge: The study contributes to the field of television history and media studies by documenting and analyzing the historical processes involved in television production technology, particularly through hands-on reenactments of past methods. This advancement enriches the academic discourse on media technology and its evolution.
Potential Influence on Future Research: This research may lead to new academic inquiries, offering a unique methodology that blends historical analysis with practical reenactments, potentially inspiring other scholars to adopt this hybrid approach.
2. Technological Advancement
Documentation and Preservation: By recreating and documenting old television production methods, the study helps preserve obsolete technologies. These technologies may inspire new innovations in digital media preservation or assist in the reconstruction of historical broadcast formats for archival and museum applications.
3. Social and Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation: The research helps preserve cultural heritage, particularly by documenting the operational aspects of early television production, which are at risk of being forgotten. This has implications for media historians, archivists, and educators aiming to understand and teach the history of television as both a cultural and technological phenomenon.
Public Engagement: The reenactments and video content could serve as tools for public history initiatives in museums, television history exhibits, or educational programs that engage the public with the evolution of television as a central medium in 20th-century culture​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Educational and Training Impact
Curriculum Development: The study offers educational tools that can be integrated into media studies curricula, particularly by providing primary resources (reenactments) that showcase the practical aspects of historical production techniques. This can enhance student learning by offering hands-on visual materials for academic use.
Training for Media Professionals: The detailed analysis of old television production techniques provides a training resource for contemporary media professionals, who might gain new insights into foundational techniques that could inform modern broadcast technology​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Interdisciplinary Collaboration: The study crosses multiple disciplines, such as history, media studies, technology, and cultural studies, making it relevant to a broad audience of academics and practitioners across the world. This interdisciplinary reach increases the global relevance of the research, particularly in regions where television history is a significant part of cultural heritage​(impact pathway).
Global Media History: The research findings are applicable globally, as the evolution of television technology and production techniques is a worldwide phenomenon that shaped media industries in Europe, North America, and beyond​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
6. Cultural and Heritage Preservation
Historical Reenactments as Cultural Artefacts: The production reenactments themselves become cultural artefacts, preserving and showcasing the operational intricacies of outdated television technologies. These artefacts could be used in museums or public exhibitions, making the study’s impacts felt in the broader public domain​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Policy and Governance Impact
Influence on Media Preservation Policy: This study could influence policies on media preservation, particularly in archival practices. Government and private institutions that focus on cultural heritage might adopt the study's findings to inform how they handle the preservation of early television broadcasts and production techniques​(impact pathway).
8. Economic Impact
Commercialization Potential: The video reenactments and historical insights could have potential for commercial use in educational platforms, documentaries, or broadcasting networks that wish to explore historical programming. This creates opportunities for monetization through licensing or collaboration with educational media companies​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Innovation and Methodological Impact
Disruption in Historical Research Methods: The use of reenactments and practical reproductions of historical technologies introduces an innovative research methodology. This disruptive approach challenges traditional archival and textual analysis by providing a more immersive and experimental way of studying media history​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability of Media Heritage: By preserving obsolete production technologies through documentation and reenactment, this study contributes to the long-term sustainability of media heritage. It emphasizes the importance of keeping outdated technologies alive for future study and public understanding​(Common Research Impact …).
11. Public Awareness and Education
Increased Public Awareness: The study can enhance public understanding of the history of television production, possibly being used in documentaries, museum exhibits, and public lectures. Such initiatives increase public awareness of the technological and cultural evolution of a dominant medium​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
These are the potential research impacts, categorized using established research impact dimensions, for the study in question. The impacts span across academic, social, technological, cultural, and economic domains, demonstrating both immediate and long-term significance.
