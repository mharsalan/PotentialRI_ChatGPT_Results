To assess the research impact dimensions from the provided paper based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework, here is a detailed breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The paper likely spans multiple domains of impact including academic, technological, and policy domains, given its focus on television production technologies and their historical development. For instance, the research's hands-on reenactments of historical television production could influence academic studies in media history and technology while providing practical insights for modern broadcast professionals.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: The research contributes to the academic domain by advancing knowledge in television production technology, particularly historical processes, offering media production professionals practical insights on how outdated technology has shaped modern production.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The historical reenactment approach suggests both short-term and long-term impacts. The short-term impacts include how quickly the findings can be incorporated into modern television history education. Long-term impacts include the preservation of knowledge about obsolete technologies and processes for future research.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: Short-term impact: Reenactments could be immediately used in university curricula for media studies. Long-term impact: The preservation of production techniques offers a resource for ongoing historical media research.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The stakeholders likely include media historians, television production professionals, academic researchers, and educational institutions. The work provides these groups with both historical insights and practical knowledge of past technologies.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: Direct stakeholders are historians and media professionals, while indirect stakeholders include students in media studies who benefit from the insights about historical practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research deeply impacts the field of television history, offering a niche, detailed study of media production technologies. It also has a broad interdisciplinary appeal, affecting fields such as media studies, history, and film production.
Page Reference: Methods, Page 71.
Example: The deep impact is evident in how the study revives forgotten television production practices. Broad impact arises from its applicability to both technological studies and historical analysis across different media formats.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The reenactment videos have high transferability, as they can be used in educational settings, professional training, and possibly in entertainment or documentary films. The scalability is demonstrated by how the research outcomes can be adapted for various audiences.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: The project’s videos can be scaled up from local academic use to international film festivals or museums for broad public engagement, demonstrating both scalability and transferability.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study uses hands-on media history, which is an innovative method for historical research in television production. By recreating obsolete technologies, it disrupts traditional forms of historical research.
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 71.
Example: The disruptive potential lies in how this research challenges traditional archival-based historical methods by introducing reenactments as a key form of primary research.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations include respecting the integrity of historical technologies and faithfully recreating production environments. Sustainability comes in the form of preserving media history for future generations.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: The study contributes to the sustainability of media production history by documenting and recreating processes that might otherwise be lost.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The video reenactments produced by the study can be immediately implemented in educational programs, documentary filmmaking, and even museum exhibitions.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: The research can be used by educators in media studies programs and by curators in exhibitions on television history, demonstrating high usability in both academic and public settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research crosses boundaries between media history, technology studies, and cultural preservation, giving it global relevance, particularly in fields concerned with the development of media technologies.
Page Reference: Methods, Page 71.
Example: Its relevance extends globally, as television production technologies have shaped media industries worldwide, from European television to American broadcast history.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The methodology and findings of this research exhibit resilience by remaining relevant despite the fast-changing landscape of modern media. Its adaptability is seen in how it preserves obsolete technologies for future generations to explore.
Page Reference: Results, Page 71.
Example: The hands-on history method ensures that as media production technologies evolve, there remains a way to engage with and learn from historical techniques, ensuring the research’s adaptability over time.
