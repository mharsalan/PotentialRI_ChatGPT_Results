
Based on the detailed reading of the attached study titled "Learning and Action Alliance framework to facilitate stakeholder collaboration and social learning in urban flood risk management", here is a breakdown of the Research Impact Dimensions for this study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Environmental Science and Flood Risk Management: The study focuses on improving urban flood risk management through collaborative frameworks and stakeholder engagement, addressing the need for sustainable water and flood management systems in urban settings.
Social Learning and Governance: The research significantly contributes to the understanding of how social learning through Learning and Action Alliances (LAAs) can influence governance structures and cross-organizational collaboration.
Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The integration of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) as part of urban planning for flood resilience is another important domain the study impacts.
