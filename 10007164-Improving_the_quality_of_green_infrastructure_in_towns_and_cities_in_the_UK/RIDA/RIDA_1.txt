
Based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework extracted from the attached file, I will now apply these dimensions to assess the potential research impact of the study related to Sustainable Urban Drainage – Retrofitting for Improved Flood Mitigation in City Centres.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
This research has an impact across multiple domains:

Academic Domain: It advances the understanding of urban water management and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), offering new data and approaches for retrofitting urban infrastructure in city centers to mitigate flood risks.
Environmental Domain: The study addresses challenges in environmental sustainability, especially in reducing pluvial flooding in dense urban areas through natural systems like green roofs, permeable paving, and rain gardens.
Policy Domain: The findings can influence urban planning policies and regulations related to sustainable urban drainage. The insights provided may shape legislation on how cities manage stormwater runoff, promoting eco-friendly alternatives to traditional grey infrastructure.
Social Domain: The research highlights the broader social benefits of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS), such as improved biodiversity and better urban environments, which can lead to enhanced public spaces.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Short-term Impact: The immediate application of this research could influence urban planners and surveyors who are looking to retrofit existing infrastructure. Its adoption in Melbourne and Newcastle could lead to immediate reductions in urban flooding and related damage.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the findings can have a lasting impact by forming the foundation for city-wide sustainable drainage policies and influencing urban design and development in many cities worldwide.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI):
Direct Stakeholders:
Urban planners, surveyors, and city councils will directly benefit from this research, using its findings to implement SUDS in urban redevelopment projects.
Commercial property owners and developers may adopt green roofs and permeable pavements to enhance property values and comply with new regulations.
Indirect Stakeholders:
The public benefits from reduced flood risk, improved urban biodiversity, and better air and water quality.
Environmental organizations and government bodies tasked with addressing climate adaptation could leverage this research to advocate for more resilient urban infrastructure.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Deep Impact: The study will have a profound influence on urban flood management and the broader field of sustainable infrastructure. It introduces retrofitting as a viable solution for city centers facing increasing flood risks due to climate change.
Broad Impact: This research crosses disciplines, impacting environmental science, urban planning, architecture, and policy-making. Its application could stretch across various sectors involved in climate change adaptation, urban development, and public policy.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Scalability: The retrofitting techniques explored in this study (green roofs, permeable pavements) can be scaled up to manage stormwater in other densely urbanized regions globally, addressing similar challenges.
Transferability: While focused on Melbourne and Newcastle, the solutions are transferable to other regions, especially cities prone to surface water flooding due to urbanization and inadequate drainage systems.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
The study proposes innovative retrofitting approaches for existing urban areas, using natural systems to address stormwater management rather than expanding costly traditional drainage systems.
This could disrupt the conventional approach to urban water management by promoting a nature-based infrastructure solution that enhances both urban resilience and environmental sustainability.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Sustainability is at the core of this research, as it seeks to implement green infrastructure solutions that are ecologically sustainable and reduce the environmental degradation caused by flooding.
Ethical Considerations include ensuring that all urban populations benefit from reduced flood risks, especially in lower-income areas that are more vulnerable to climate-related events.
8. Implementation and Usability:
The study provides practical guidance for surveyors, urban planners, and city managers on how to evaluate buildings for green roof retrofits and identify areas for permeable paving. It highlights the technical requirements and cost-benefit analyses for SUDS implementation in city centers.
Usability extends to policymakers who can use these findings to develop city-wide retrofit programs that are cost-effective and environmentally beneficial.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
The study’s findings are relevant across multiple disciplines, including environmental science, engineering, urban design, and public policy.
Its global relevance is underscored by the increasing need for urban areas around the world to adapt to climate change, particularly with the rise in extreme weather events and flooding.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
This research emphasizes the importance of creating resilient cities by promoting infrastructure that can adapt to changing climate patterns. It shows how green infrastructure can make urban areas more resilient to flooding.
It is adaptable across different climatic zones and urban configurations, as the methods studied are flexible and can be tailored to suit various geographical and economic contexts.
Conclusion:
The Sustainable Urban Drainage study presents broad and deep impacts across multiple domains. It addresses environmental sustainability, urban resilience, and policy innovation while providing practical and scalable solutions for retrofitting existing urban areas to mitigate flood risks. By following these pathways, the study holds significant potential to influence global urban planning practices, promote sustainable development, and protect cities from the growing challenges posed by climate change and urban flooding.
