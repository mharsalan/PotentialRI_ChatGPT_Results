After reviewing the study in the provided document, here are the potential research impacts of the study on green infrastructure and built environment assessment systems, based on both the content of the study and established frameworks for research impact evaluation:

1. Environmental Impact
Enhancing Green Infrastructure: The study highlights how current built environment assessment systems fail to fully capture the benefits of high-quality green infrastructure. By identifying this gap, the research can lead to more sustainable urban development practices, encouraging better integration of green spaces that contribute to biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate resilience​(7).
Improved Resilience to Climate Change: The research’s emphasis on green infrastructure’s role in climate resilience (e.g., flood management, temperature regulation) may drive policy changes that enhance urban resilience to climate change​(Common Research Impact …)​(7).
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Planning Policies: The study suggests that built environment assessment systems do not adequately prioritize green infrastructure. This can stimulate changes in urban planning policies at local, national, or even international levels, promoting stricter standards for green infrastructure inclusion in urban development​(Research impact toolkit).
Informed Decision-Making: Policymakers could use the research to develop or refine planning frameworks that include mandatory green infrastructure elements, aligning them with sustainable urbanization and nature conservation goals​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(7).
3. Social and Well-Being Impact
Improving Health and Well-being: The study demonstrates the importance of green infrastructure in promoting physical and mental health, through enhanced access to green spaces, better air quality, and recreational opportunities. The research can drive urban planning that promotes public health, leading to reductions in stress and better overall well-being in urban populations​(7)​(Common Research Impact …).
Community Engagement and Awareness: By advocating for more integrated green spaces in urban areas, the research has the potential to raise public awareness about the value of green infrastructure, encouraging communities to advocate for greener urban developments​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Economic Impact
Cost Savings and Efficiency in Urban Planning: Effective integration of green infrastructure in development processes could lead to long-term economic savings for cities by reducing the need for expensive engineered solutions (e.g., stormwater management systems). This has the potential to generate significant cost efficiencies for municipalities​(Common Research Impact …).
Increased Property Values: As green infrastructure improves the livability of urban areas, there could be positive economic effects on property values and attractiveness of real estate in areas with well-designed green spaces​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Technological and Methodological Innovation
Advancing Assessment Systems: The study identifies gaps in existing assessment systems like BREEAM and LEED regarding green infrastructure evaluation. This can lead to the development of more advanced tools and technologies for assessing the multifunctionality and sustainability of urban developments​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Innovation in Green Infrastructure Design: Insights from the study can inspire innovative approaches to urban green space design that are more integrated with urban ecosystems, potentially driving the adoption of novel techniques such as green roofs, walls, and corridors in urban planning​(7)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Interdisciplinary Approaches: The research bridges environmental science, urban planning, public health, and sustainability. Its findings are globally relevant as they contribute to solving shared challenges in urban sustainability, making the research applicable across different regions facing similar urbanization pressures​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Global Impact on Urban Sustainability Frameworks: The study’s emphasis on improving built environment assessment systems could influence global standards and frameworks for sustainable urban planning, such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness of Sustainable Urban Design: The study can contribute to public debates on sustainable urban living, educating both professionals and the general public on the importance of green infrastructure and its benefits for urban ecosystems and public health​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Capacity Building in the Built Environment Sector: By addressing the skills gap in delivering high-quality green infrastructure, the research could result in improved training and capacity building for urban planners and developers, encouraging more sustainable practices in the built environment sector​(7)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Ethical Urban Development: The research advocates for more ethical urban development practices that prioritize environmental sustainability and equitable access to green spaces, promoting social justice in urban environments​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Long-term Sustainability: It emphasizes the role of green infrastructure in long-term sustainability planning, helping cities become more adaptable to environmental changes, thereby contributing to global sustainability efforts​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Building a Knowledge Base on Green Infrastructure: The research adds to the scientific literature on sustainable urban planning, offering new insights into how green infrastructure can be better evaluated and integrated into assessment systems​(Research Impact Knowled…). This knowledge could inspire further studies in related fields such as ecology, public health, and urban resilience​(Common Research Impact …)​(7).
10. Cultural and Social Impact
Shaping Cultural Norms in Urban Development: By highlighting the multifunctional benefits of green infrastructure, the study may influence cultural perceptions of what constitutes a sustainable city, fostering a broader societal shift towards valuing green spaces in urban design​(Research impact toolkit)​(7).
Social Cohesion and Urban Quality of Life: Enhanced green spaces can promote social interactions, community engagement, and cohesion, thereby improving the quality of life for urban dwellers​(Research impact toolkit)​(7).
These potential research impacts align with the frameworks of research impact assessment, spanning environmental, social, policy, and economic domains. The research has the capacity to contribute to a broad range of positive outcomes, particularly in promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life through better integration of green infrastructure.
