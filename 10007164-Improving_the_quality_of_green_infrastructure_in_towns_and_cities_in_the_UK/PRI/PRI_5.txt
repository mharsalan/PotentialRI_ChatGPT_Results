
Based on the study on green roof retrofits for stormwater attenuation, the potential research impacts span across multiple dimensions. Here are the key potential research impacts of this study:

1. Environmental Impact
Flood Risk Mitigation: The primary environmental impact is the reduction in urban flood risks through stormwater management. Green roofs help attenuate stormwater runoff, reduce peak flows during heavy rainfall events, and mimic natural water infiltration patterns. This can significantly decrease the pressure on urban drainage systems and mitigate the likelihood of flooding in central business districts.
Improved Urban Air and Water Quality: The study shows that green roofs can filter pollutants from rainwater before it reaches city drainage systems. Additionally, green roofs improve air quality by capturing airborne pollutants and producing oxygen through plant photosynthesis, contributing to healthier urban environments.
Biodiversity Enhancement: By incorporating vegetation, green roofs provide habitats for urban wildlife, including birds, insects, and pollinators. This helps create biodiversity corridors in cities where green spaces are limited, thus supporting urban ecosystems.
2. Public Health and Wellbeing
Reduction of Urban Heat Islands: The study demonstrates how green roofs can reduce the urban heat island effect by cooling rooftop surfaces and lowering surrounding air temperatures. This can improve thermal comfort for city dwellers and reduce energy demands for cooling, contributing to public health during heat waves.
Mental Health and Recreational Benefits: Green roofs also provide aesthetic and recreational benefits to urban residents. Access to green spaces in densely built environments has been linked to improved mental health, reduced stress, and increased well-being. Publicly accessible green roofs in office buildings or residential areas offer spaces for relaxation and social interaction.
3. Social and Community Impact
Community Engagement and Education: Implementing green roofs in urban settings can encourage local community involvement in environmental sustainability. The study suggests that community education programs can increase public understanding of the benefits of green infrastructure, thereby fostering greater support for green roof retrofits.
Increased Social Interaction in Urban Spaces: When designed for public use, green roofs can offer valuable social spaces where residents and workers gather, promoting social cohesion and enhancing the quality of life in urban areas.
4. Economic Impact
Cost-Effective Stormwater Management: The study highlights how green roof retrofits offer a more cost-effective solution for managing stormwater compared to traditional gray infrastructure (e.g., underground stormwater pipes). This can result in significant savings for cities facing high costs from flood damage or upgrading aging stormwater systems.
Increased Property Values: Well-maintained green roofs can increase the attractiveness of urban buildings, leading to higher property values and increased marketability of residential and commercial properties. The study points out that real estate developers and building owners may see financial benefits from incorporating green roofs, particularly in terms of rental or resale value.
Energy Savings: The cooling effects of green roofs reduce the need for air conditioning, which can lower energy consumption in buildings. This translates to long-term financial savings for property owners and tenants, while also contributing to energy efficiency in urban areas.
5. Policy and Governance Impact
Integration into Urban Development Policies: The study provides evidence that green roof retrofits should be integrated into urban planning policies to promote climate resilience. Governments could mandate or incentivize green roof installations in new developments and retrofits, particularly in areas prone to flooding or extreme heat.
Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD): By positioning green roofs as a key component of WSUD strategies, the study encourages city planners to adopt these systems as part of a broader framework for sustainable urban development. Policymakers could create guidelines or offer financial incentives to encourage the uptake of green infrastructure in commercial districts.
6. Educational and Professional Development Impact
Training for Urban Planners and Architects: The study identifies a need for education and training in green roof technologies. As this area of urban design grows, there is a clear need for curriculum development at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels to prepare future architects, planners, and engineers. The study highlights the importance of technical training in roof retrofits, stormwater management, and green infrastructure design.
Best Practice Guidelines for Practitioners: The study points out that many built environment professionals lack the technical knowledge required to evaluate and implement green roof retrofits. Developing best practice guidelines will help surveyors, urban planners, and engineers provide accurate advice to clients and stakeholders about the technical and economic benefits of green roofs.
Conclusion
This study has the potential for far-reaching impacts across multiple dimensions, including environmental sustainability, public health, social cohesion, economic development, and policy reform. By highlighting the benefits of green roof retrofits for stormwater attenuation, it can influence the adoption of sustainable urban practices in cities worldwide, helping to address key challenges like urban flooding, heat islands, and declining biodiversity. Additionally, the study advocates for the education and upskilling of urban professionals to ensure the successful implementation and long-term maintenance of green infrastructure.
