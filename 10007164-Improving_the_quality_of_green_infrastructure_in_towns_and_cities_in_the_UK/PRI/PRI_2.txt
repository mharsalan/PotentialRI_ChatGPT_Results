
Based on the provided study, the potential research impacts of this study on the assessment and delivery of high-quality green infrastructure (GI) in the built environment are as follows:

1. Policy and Governance Impact
This study proposes a comprehensive framework for assessing green infrastructure (GI) quality, which can be adopted by local and national governments to improve urban planning and development policies. The study highlights the discrepancy between statutory guidance and the actual delivery of high-quality green infrastructure. Therefore, this framework could influence urban planning policies and statutory guidance, ensuring better integration of GI in city planning, especially in the UK. This will ultimately promote sustainable urban development and climate resilience through enhanced planning frameworks.

Impact Dimensions: Improved urban planning policies and statutory reforms.

2. Environmental and Ecological Impact
The research emphasizes the role of green infrastructure in supporting biodiversity, mitigating climate change impacts, enhancing water management, and improving air and soil quality. Implementing the proposed framework could result in cities that are more resilient to environmental challenges such as flooding, heatwaves, and loss of biodiversity. These efforts would also contribute to the restoration of ecological networks, improve the viability of key species, and reverse biodiversity decline in urban areas.

Impact Dimensions: Enhanced biodiversity, ecological network restoration, and environmental resilience.

3. Public Health and Wellbeing
The study’s framework ties green infrastructure directly to health and wellbeing outcomes. By ensuring that high-quality GI is designed and placed near communities, the framework promotes mental and physical health benefits. Access to green spaces has been linked to reductions in stress, improved community cohesion, and support for active lifestyles. Therefore, the study’s recommendations could significantly impact public health, particularly in urban areas where access to natural spaces is often limited.

Impact Dimensions: Reduced public health disparities, enhanced wellbeing, and community cohesion.

4. Economic Impact
By advocating for high-quality GI that is integrated into urban planning, the study could influence real estate development and urban renewal projects. Green spaces are known to increase property values and attract investments into neighborhoods. Furthermore, effective GI reduces costs associated with urban flood management and heat mitigation, offering a cost-effective approach to sustainable city development.

Impact Dimensions: Increased property values, reduced infrastructure costs, and improved local economies.

5. Climate Change Adaptation
The framework directly addresses the role of green infrastructure in climate change adaptation, such as managing urban heat islands, improving stormwater management, and providing carbon storage. The study contributes to ongoing global discussions on urban climate resilience by providing practical solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change on urban populations.

Impact Dimensions: Urban climate resilience, flood mitigation, and heat island reduction.

6. Educational and Professional Development
This study could have a lasting impact on education and professional training for urban planners, architects, and developers. The framework developed in the study serves as a benchmark for what constitutes high-quality GI and could become part of professional curricula and guidelines for urban planning, landscape architecture, and environmental design.

Impact Dimensions: Improved education and training in sustainable urban development.

Conclusion
The study on green infrastructure assessment has the potential to influence urban development policies, improve environmental and public health outcomes, and promote sustainable urbanization on a global scale. The framework it introduces could reshape how green spaces are valued, designed, and maintained in cities, with broad-reaching impacts on climate adaptation, biodiversity, and community wellbeing. These impacts align well with various research impact dimensions, ensuring that the findings have both immediate and long-term benefits for cities and their inhabitants.
