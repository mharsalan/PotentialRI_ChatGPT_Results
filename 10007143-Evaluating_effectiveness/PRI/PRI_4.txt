After thoroughly reviewing the text and the research impact dimensions from the provided documents, here are the potential research impacts of the study based on the predefined dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: The study provides substantial contributions to academic discourse by offering a critique of evidence-based policies (EBP), especially in the social sciences. It challenges existing theories and introduces middle-range theory as an alternative framework.
Policy Domain: By criticizing EBP, the study directly informs policy-making, especially where policymakers rely heavily on scientific evidence to shape policy. This could result in the adoption of more nuanced policy frameworks.
Social Domain: The insights from the study could influence societal debates around the effectiveness of policies based solely on evidence. It has the potential to shift how societies and governments approach social policy and governance.
Educational Domain: The study might impact educational curricula, especially in social science courses. Concepts like middle-range theory could become more integrated into teaching, potentially reshaping how social scientists are trained to approach policy research.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study could quickly influence ongoing debates on EBP, especially among policymakers and academics who are already engaged with these concepts.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the study may have a lasting influence on how social sciences approach policy-making frameworks, possibly shaping new generations of researchers and policymakers.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Social scientists, policymakers, and researchers in evidence-based practices are immediate beneficiaries, as they could use this framework to improve their methodologies.
Indirect Stakeholders: Societal groups, NGOs, and governmental organizations that implement or rely on evidence-based policies would indirectly benefit from this research by having better tools and frameworks for policy decisions.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study has a deep impact within the academic domain, particularly in social sciences and philosophy, challenging the foundations of EBP and proposing alternative methods.
Broad Impact: Its concepts could extend across various domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, influencing how evidence is used across disciplines and policies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The framework and insights from this study could be scaled up for larger applications in public policy beyond the local or national level, potentially influencing international organizations and governments.
Transferability: Concepts from the study could be transferred to other fields, such as healthcare policy, where evidence-based approaches are similarly dominant.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study introduces innovative critiques of the EBP movement, disrupting traditional reliance on pure empirical evidence. It promotes alternative methods that could encourage more flexible and context-specific approaches to policymaking.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
By promoting a more context-aware approach to policymaking, the study encourages policies that are more socially sustainable and ethically aligned, especially by focusing on the practices rather than evidence alone, which can sometimes overlook ethical considerations in policymaking.
8. Implementation and Usability
The middle-range theory proposed in the study is highly implementable in policy settings. Its emphasis on practical usability across diverse contexts means policymakers can adopt its principles without needing complete overhauls of existing systems.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
This research is relevant across disciplines and globally. It could impact how different countries and academic fields (such as economics, healthcare, education) apply and critique EBP. Its principles are adaptable to a wide range of societal challenges globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study's emphasis on middle-range theories highlights its adaptability to changing societal and policy contexts. As new challenges emerge, such as shifts in political or social priorities, the concepts in the study can be adapted to continue providing relevant solutions.
11. Policy Influence and Advocacy
The research has the potential to strongly influence policy-making, advocating for a more nuanced approach to evidence in policymaking. This may result in more flexible, responsive policies that better serve societal needs.
12. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
The study contributes to the body of knowledge by offering new frameworks and critiques of existing theories. It advances the understanding of how evidence is used in policy, adding depth to the discourse on policy-making and social governance.
13. Public Awareness and Education
Beyond academia and policy, the study could enhance public awareness around how evidence is used in creating policies. This may lead to more informed public debates and possibly even influence voting patterns or public support for certain policies.
14. Equity and Inclusivity
By advocating for policies that account for context and practice, the study indirectly promotes more equitable policies that consider the diverse conditions in which policies are applied, potentially reducing disparities in policy impacts.
15. Behavioral Change
The study could influence changes in the behavior of policymakers and social scientists, encouraging them to adopt a more flexible and critical approach to the use of evidence in decision-making.
16. International Collaboration and Diplomacy
By addressing global policy issues and offering critiques relevant to international organizations (like the OECD or World Bank), this research fosters international collaboration, influencing how countries cooperate on evidence-based policies.
17. Risk Reduction and Safety Improvement
The research could lead to more robust policy frameworks that reduce risks of policy failures, especially in areas like healthcare, education, and economic governance, where rigid evidence-based policies may fall short.
This study presents potential impacts across multiple domains, with significant contributions to academic discourse, policymaking, and societal governance. Its interdisciplinary relevance and focus on sustainable, ethical policymaking make it a critical piece of work for both short-term applications and long-term influence.
