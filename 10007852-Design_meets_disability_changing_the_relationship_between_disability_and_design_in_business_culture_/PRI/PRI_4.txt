
Based on the research study provided, I have identified several potential research impacts aligned with common research impact dimensions. These are organized by types of impacts, reflecting their broad societal, academic, economic, and environmental significance:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Theoretical Frameworks in Design: The study contributes to new knowledge within the academic domain by merging fashion design with disability-inclusive participatory design methodologies. It helps establish theoretical frameworks for inclusive design, particularly in wearable technologies and prosthetics.
Research on Co-Design Methodologies: The study advances the methodological framework of co-design by demonstrating how stakeholders (prosthetic users) can be integrated into the design process, making the findings applicable to both academia and industry.
2. Societal and Cultural Impact
Empowerment through Design: The research highlights the importance of involving users (specifically disabled individuals) in the design process, which promotes inclusivity and social empowerment. This societal impact is critical in raising awareness about disability and influencing social norms towards acceptance and inclusivity​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Behavioral Change: By promoting co-design with disabled users, the study encourages a shift in how fashion designers and manufacturers perceive their role in catering to disabled individuals, fostering a more inclusive and socially responsible industry​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Health and Well-being Impact
Improved Quality of Life: The study’s design improvements for prosthetic wearers directly enhance the well-being of individuals by offering products that meet their functional and aesthetic needs, contributing to a higher quality of life​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
4. Technological Innovation and Commercialization
Innovation in Prosthetics: The integration of fashion and prosthetics showcases technological advancements in wearable designs that could lead to new, customizable prosthetic products with higher aesthetic value, potentially opening avenues for commercialization​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Scalability in Manufacturing: The techniques developed for integrating fashion with functional prosthetics could be scaled up, making them commercially viable for broader markets, both in the fashion and healthcare industries​(impact pathway).
5. Economic Impact
Job Creation and Industry Growth: The commercialization potential of fashionable, functional prosthetics may stimulate economic growth by creating jobs in niche industries such as custom prosthetic design and manufacturing​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cost Efficiency in Design: By improving the usability and acceptance of prosthetics, the research has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with ill-fitting or rejected prosthetic designs, leading to broader economic benefits​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Environmental Impact
Sustainable Design Practices: The research encourages the adoption of sustainable materials and ethical design practices in prosthetics, which could contribute to reducing environmental waste in the manufacturing process​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Design Standards and Legislation: This research could influence policy related to disability rights, encouraging the adoption of inclusive design standards within the fashion and healthcare industries. By pushing for changes in how products for disabled individuals are designed, the research could impact disability legislation​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Adoption of Inclusive Design: The cross-disciplinary nature of the research, merging fashion, healthcare, and disability studies, holds significant global relevance. It can be adapted by industries across different countries to promote disability-inclusive design practices worldwide​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Resilience and Adaptability
Adaptable Design Processes: The participatory nature of the research ensures that prosthetic designs remain adaptable to user needs, ensuring long-term relevance as both fashion trends and healthcare technologies evolve​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Ethical and Sustainable Considerations
Ethics of Inclusivity: The study’s emphasis on the motto "Nothing About Us Without Us" ensures that the research adheres to ethical standards by prioritizing the voices of disabled individuals in the design process. This approach helps mitigate the risk of exclusion and ensures the research aligns with broader societal goals of fairness and justice​(Research Impact Knowled…).
This comprehensive overview of potential research impacts illustrates how the study influences multiple domains, from academia to societal practices, health, and technology, and emphasizes its broader relevance for sustainable and inclusive design practices.
