
Based on the entire text of the study "Super normal design for extraordinary bodies" by Graham Pullin, and using the research impact dimensions and potential impacts from the various sources provided, I have identified several potential research impacts organized by type of impact. These are aligned with the common impact dimensions and types.

1. Academic Impact
The study has significant potential to advance academic knowledge across multiple fields:

Design Theory: The concept of "super normal" design, which challenges existing norms in assistive technology design, introduces a new theoretical framework in disability and design studies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).
Interdisciplinary Influence: It bridges design, disability studies, and cultural theory, offering fresh perspectives on how objects for disabled individuals can be designed not just for functionality but also with cultural resonance and dignity​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Methodological Innovations: By critiquing both the medical and social models of disability, it invites academic discourse on more nuanced approaches to disability that could impact how future studies are framed in sociology and anthropology​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Societal Impact
Cultural Perceptions: The research challenges societal perceptions of disability, advocating for the integration of disabled individuals into everyday life through better design practices. This has the potential to shift public attitudes, reducing stigma and promoting inclusivity​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Public Awareness: By promoting the idea of "super normal" design, the research can influence public discussions on how assistive devices are perceived, normalizing their presence and reducing societal "othering" of disabled individuals​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Health and Well-being Impact
Improvement in Quality of Life: The concept of creating aesthetically pleasing yet functional assistive devices can improve the psychological well-being of disabled individuals, who may feel more integrated and accepted in society when using objects designed with care and normalcy in mind​(Research impact toolkit).
Mental Health: The rejection of "tragic" or "triumphant" narratives in favor of a normalized view of disability can contribute positively to the mental health of disabled individuals by lessening societal pressures related to identity and appearance​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Economic Impact
Commercial Opportunities in Design: The study suggests a market for products that are inclusive, culturally resonant, and designed for the mass market rather than as niche assistive devices. This could lead to commercial ventures in product design and manufacturing aimed at inclusivity​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Expansion of the Design Market: Companies focusing on inclusive design could benefit from tapping into a growing demand for products that blend aesthetics with functionality, fostering innovation and economic growth in the design and manufacturing industries​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Technological Advancement and Innovation
Innovative Design Solutions: The study calls for a shift away from clinical-looking assistive technologies toward products that blend in with everyday life. This could inspire technological advancements in materials, production techniques, and user-centered design that focus on inclusivity and accessibility​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruption of Traditional Models: The concept of "super normal" disability objects could disrupt the assistive technology sector by moving beyond traditional medical models, encouraging the development of products that align with mainstream design trends while remaining highly functional​(impact pathway).
6. Environmental Impact and Sustainability
Sustainable Design: By promoting products that are designed for long-term use and cultural integration, the study indirectly encourages sustainability in product development. These designs aim to be timeless and adaptable, reducing the need for frequent replacement or disposal, which aligns with principles of environmental sustainability​(Common Research Impact …).
7. Policy Impact
Influence on Design and Disability Policy: The study could impact public policy by informing government and institutional frameworks around inclusive design and accessibility standards. Policymakers may adopt the research to update regulations and guidelines for designing public spaces and products that are more inclusive of disabled individuals​(impact pathway).
Advocacy for Inclusive Design Standards: By presenting a new framework for inclusive design, the research could support advocacy efforts aimed at making accessibility a more central consideration in design standards across industries​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development in Design Education: The research may influence how design is taught in universities, encouraging a shift towards more inclusive, human-centered design approaches. Students in design programs could be taught to prioritize not just functionality but also cultural and social considerations in their work​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Training for Future Designers: By introducing new design philosophies, the study can help train future designers to be more mindful of the social and cultural implications of their work, particularly when designing for marginalized groups​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Social and Cultural Impact
Normalization of Disability: The study aims to normalize disability in everyday life by designing products that do not stand out as "special" but rather fit into the broader social and cultural landscape. This could lead to societal changes in how disabled individuals are viewed and treated​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cultural Shifts in Perception: The research challenges the narrative of disability as either a tragedy or a triumph, potentially leading to broader cultural shifts in how society understands and interacts with disabled individuals​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Behavioral Change
Impact on Design Practices: Designers and manufacturers may be influenced to change their approach to creating products for disabled individuals, moving away from purely functional designs to those that integrate aesthetics and cultural relevance. This could lead to widespread changes in industry practices​(Common Research Impact …).
Consumer Behavior: As products that align with the "super normal" design philosophy become more common, consumers may begin to favor inclusive products that integrate seamlessly into everyday life, contributing to changing purchasing behaviors​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
Promotion of Inclusivity: The research directly addresses equity by promoting the design of products that do not segregate or "other" disabled individuals. By advocating for designs that are universally applicable, it helps ensure that disabled people are considered in mainstream product development​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Addressing Social Disparities: By designing products that disabled individuals can use without drawing unwanted attention, the research helps address social disparities, fostering greater inclusivity and reducing the stigma around assistive devices​(Research Impact Knowled…).
This study aligns well with a variety of potential research impacts, notably in societal, academic, economic, and cultural domains. It presents significant opportunities for shaping inclusive design practices and advancing disability studies, offering long-term benefits across multiple sectors.
