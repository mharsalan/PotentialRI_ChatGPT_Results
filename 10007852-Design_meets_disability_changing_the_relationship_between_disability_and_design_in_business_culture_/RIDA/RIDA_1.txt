Example: Direct stakeholders include designers who will use these insights to create better products for disabled users. Indirect stakeholders include the disabled population and the general public, who will benefit from improved public policies influenced by this research.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

Deep Impact: It deeply influences the field of inclusive design, challenging traditional approaches and pushing forward new critical design methodologies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Broad Impact: The research spans beyond design, affecting sectors like public policy, healthcare, and technology by advocating for inclusivity and accessibility​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Deep impact is evident in transforming the design discipline's approach to disability. Broad impact can be seen in how it influences policy decisions regarding disability rights and accessible technologies.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The concepts introduced, such as critical design for disabilities, are scalable across different industries, from healthcare to technology​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
The design principles could be transferred to different geographic regions and industries, offering a model for inclusive practices globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research's findings on inclusive design can be scaled for use in different fields such as product design and policy, and transferred to educational programs or international disability policies.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

Innovation: It introduces new ideas on the intersection of disability and design, with approaches such as "experience prototyping" that could revolutionize how assistive devices are created​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: The research disrupts traditional design methods by proposing that disability be treated as a lens for design innovation rather than a limitation​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: This research is innovative because it redefines how designers approach assistive technology. It is disruptive by challenging the status quo of design practices and introducing a more inclusive perspective.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Sustainability: The research calls for long-lasting, inclusive design solutions that cater to the needs of disabled populations without contributing to "wastefulness" in technology development​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: It tackles ethical issues related to the representation of disabled people and how design can either perpetuate or challenge societal biases​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Sustainable impact is evident in the push for durable, long-term assistive devices that remain relevant as user needs evolve. Ethical considerations are embedded in discussions about how design choices affect disabled individuals' dignity and autonomy.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The study emphasizes how critical design can be implemented to meet real-world needs, particularly for disabled individuals who rely on functional, user-friendly assistive technologies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
The usability of these designs is grounded in practical applications, as shown in the research's focus on designing communication aids​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research offers insights into how designers can implement new tools that are usable for disabled populations, ensuring that these tools are both functional and accessible.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

Cross-disciplinary: The research integrates insights from design, healthcare, and disability studies to create more comprehensive design frameworks​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The principles of inclusive design can be applied worldwide, helping to address global challenges in accessibility and disability rights​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Cross-disciplinary relevance is shown through the combination of design with social science and healthcare. Global relevance is reflected in how these design strategies can be adopted internationally, influencing global disability policies.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
