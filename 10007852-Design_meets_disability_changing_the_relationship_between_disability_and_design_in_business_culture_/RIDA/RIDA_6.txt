
To assess the research impact dimensions for "Super normal design for extraordinary bodies" by Graham Pullin, based on the top 10 research impact dimensions provided in the reference text, here is a detailed breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The paper intersects the fields of design, disability studies, and sociology. It advocates for "super normal" design—objects that are created yet familiar, self-assured yet understated, unapologetic yet unremarkable—to address disability in everyday contexts (Introduction, page 166).
It challenges both the medical and social models of disability by proposing a nuanced approach that reflects the lived experience of disabled individuals (Beyond Tragedy and Triumph, page 167).
The design approach also taps into broader cultural and societal implications by repositioning disability as part of everyday life (Introduction, page 166).
Page Reference and Section:
Introduction, page 166; Beyond Tragedy and Triumph, page 167.

Example:
The research contributes to sociology, disability studies, and design, influencing how disability is perceived in society and how objects are designed to be both functional and culturally resonant.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The paper has the potential for long-term impact by introducing the concept of super normal design, which could influence both future academic research and practical design applications (Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 176).
It suggests that this framework could serve as an ongoing model for creating design solutions that transcend traditional disability aesthetics (Conclusion, page 176).
Page Reference and Section:
Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 176.

Example:
The theoretical framework proposed could have a long-term impact by influencing future design standards in disability-related products.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The direct stakeholders are designers and disabled individuals, as the paper repositions disability objects within the realm of mainstream design (Reintroducing Extraordinary Bodies, page 171).
Indirectly, the research impacts policy-makers in disability advocacy and healthcare providers who manage assistive technologies (Beyond Tragedy and Triumph, page 167).
Page Reference and Section:
Reintroducing Extraordinary Bodies, page 171.

Example:
The primary stakeholders include designers aiming to create inclusive products and disabled individuals who benefit from more thoughtful, culturally integrated design objects.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The paper's deep impact is within disability-led design, fundamentally changing the way assistive products are conceptualized (Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168).
It also has broad impact across multiple fields, including design, cultural studies, and disability advocacy (Appropriating Super Normal Design, page 174).
Page Reference and Section:
Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168.

Example:
The research has a deep impact on disability design and a broad impact by influencing discussions in disability studies, industrial design, and social inclusivity.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The concept of super normal design is highly transferable to various disability-related products, from prosthetic limbs to wheelchairs and hearing aids (Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 175).
It can be scaled across different cultures and societies, adapting to local norms while maintaining its foundational principles (The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170).
Page Reference and Section:
Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 175; The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170.

Example:
The idea could be scaled to various assistive technologies and transferred to different cultural contexts, making disability-related design more inclusive globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research is innovative as it introduces the idea of "super normal" disability objects that move away from traditional medical aesthetics (Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168).
It disrupts the conventional approaches to disability design by rejecting both triumphalist and tragic narratives (Beyond Tragedy and Triumph, page 167).
Page Reference and Section:
Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168; Beyond Tragedy and Triumph, page 167.

Example:
The research is disruptive within disability design by challenging established models and proposing a novel, more inclusive design philosophy.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The paper discusses the ethical implications of designing objects that are deeply integrated into everyday life, promoting dignity and inclusion without stigmatization (Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168).
It also touches on the long-term sustainability of these designs, as they are not meant to be fleeting trends but enduring solutions (The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170).
Page Reference and Section:
Introducing Super Normal Design, page 168; The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170.

Example:
The research promotes ethical design practices that ensure long-term sustainability and inclusivity for disabled individuals.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The practical implementation of super normal design is emphasized as key, suggesting that these products should be designed for everyday use without drawing unnecessary attention (Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 175).
Usability is considered critical, ensuring that designs are intuitive and seamlessly integrated into the user's life (The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170).
Page Reference and Section:
Towards Super Normal Disability Objects, page 175; The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170.

Example:
The usability of such designs ensures they are practical and non-intrusive, making them easy to implement in real-world settings.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The paper holds relevance across design, disability studies, and sociology, demonstrating its potential for cross-disciplinary influence (Reintroducing Extraordinary Bodies, page 171).
Globally, it challenges societal norms about disability across cultures, suggesting that super normal design could be adapted in various cultural contexts (The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170).
Page Reference and Section:
Reintroducing Extraordinary Bodies, page 171; The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170.

Example:
The research is cross-disciplinary, influencing both academic fields and global design practices in multiple cultural contexts.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The concept of super normal design is inherently adaptable, designed to evolve with cultural shifts and societal changes in perceptions of disability (Appropriating Super Normal Design, page 174).
The resilience of these designs lies in their timelessness and ability to fit within various contexts without becoming outdated (The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170).
Page Reference and Section:
Appropriating Super Normal Design, page 174; The Paradox of Super Normal, page 170.

Example:
The adaptability of super normal designs ensures they remain relevant and resilient across different societal changes, particularly in how disability is viewed globally.

This analysis highlights the key dimensions of research impact for Pullin's "Super normal design for extraordinary bodies," emphasizing its influence across various academic and societal domains.
