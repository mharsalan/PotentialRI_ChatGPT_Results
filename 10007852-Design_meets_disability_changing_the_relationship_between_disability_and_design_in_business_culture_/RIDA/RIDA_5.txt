
Based on the file you uploaded and the top 10 dimensions of research impact, here is the detailed assessment of the "Hands of X" research project across each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "Hands of X is a collection... that encourages wearers to choose from a range of materials and create a hand that feels their own." The project intersects with fields of design, prosthetics, disability studies, and social empowerment. It involved a participatory process bringing together amputees, prosthetists, and designers.
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: This research contributes to the health domain (prosthetic development), the social domain (increasing awareness of limb difference), and the design domain (innovative product design tailored to individual needs). It promotes ownership and personal identity in medical device design, thereby impacting both health practices and social empowerment.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "Visitors were invited to contribute their experience and imagination by taking part in the next phase of this active research project."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: This research has long-term impact as it establishes a continuous, participatory design process that will influence future prosthetic design innovations. The exhibit's invitation for ongoing public input ensures that it will remain relevant as prosthetic needs and materials evolve.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "The exhibition... unpacked the participatory process that brought people with limb difference and amputees together with designers, prosthetists, and makers."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The direct stakeholders include amputees and prosthetists, who benefit from new prosthetic designs that offer customization and personal ownership. Indirect stakeholders are broader audiences, including the medical community and policymakers who may use these designs as models for patient-centered care innovations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The exhibit recreated a prototype consultation service that was installed in an eyewear shop." This highlights the creative integration of prosthetics design into retail and fashion spaces.
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The research demonstrates broad impact by crossing into retail and fashion domains, broadening the scope of prosthetic use beyond medical fields. It also has deep impact in the medical device industry by innovating prosthetic customization and user autonomy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Visitors were invited to contribute their experience... exploring how choice can bring a sense of ownership."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The research is transferable to various prosthetic designs and fields where user choice is important, such as wearable technology or assistive devices. Its participatory design model is scalable across medical practices that prioritize patient empowerment and personalized care.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The exhibit... unpacked the participatory process that brought people with limb difference and amputees together with designers, prosthetists, and makers."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: This research is innovative in how it integrates users into the design process, giving them the power to influence the prosthetics they use. It disrupts traditional medical device manufacturing by emphasizing aesthetic and personal customization, moving away from purely functional prosthetic solutions.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Hands of X: Design Meets Disability was realized in partnership... and supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The research upholds ethical principles by fostering inclusivity and empowering amputees to co-design prosthetic solutions. It supports sustainability in terms of social sustainability, focusing on long-term empowerment of individuals with disabilities and challenging societal perceptions of prosthetics.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Visitors were invited to contribute their experience and imagination... exploring how choice can bring a sense of ownership."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The project's design process has high usability because it allows prosthetics users to co-create their own devices, making the results highly personalized and more likely to be adopted by users. The exhibition format also shows potential for public engagement and immediate user feedback, ensuring practical application in real-world settings.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The Michelin Design Gallery is a responsive programme of dynamic and challenging projects... exploring the breadth of practice the design world embraces."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: This research is cross-disciplinary, integrating design, healthcare, and social empowerment. It has global relevance, addressing the universal need for prosthetics that allow for individual expression and identity, which can be adapted across cultures and healthcare systems globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The exhibition also unpacked the participatory process that brought people with limb difference and amputees together with designers..."
Section & Page: Overview, page 72​(5).
Example: The participatory nature of the research ensures its adaptability, allowing for continuous input from users and designers as prosthetic technologies and user needs evolve. Its resilience lies in its focus on personal identity and customization, which are likely to remain relevant regardless of changes in technology or materials.
This analysis maps how the "Hands of X" project aligns with various research impact dimensions, highlighting its potential to influence multiple fields, promote inclusivity, and drive innovation in prosthetic design.
