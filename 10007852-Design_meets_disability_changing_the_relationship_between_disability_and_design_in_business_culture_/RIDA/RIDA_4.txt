
Here is the analysis of the research paper across the top 10 dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research presented contributes primarily to the domain of fashion design, with an interdisciplinary connection to disability studies and participatory design. The study focuses on prosthetics and wearable design, emphasizing disability-led fashion.
Page Reference: Throughout the study (Hands of X), participatory design approaches with prosthetics professionals and wearers significantly impact fashion and disability-inclusive design​(4).
Example: This research enriches the academic domain by providing a novel approach to inclusive fashion design. In the social domain, it contributes to societal change by promoting empowerment within the disabled community, aligning with the motto "Nothing About Us Without Us."
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The work highlights both immediate and long-term impacts. In the short term, it influences the design of prosthetics and fashion items for individuals with disabilities, while in the long term, it may redefine industry standards in disability-inclusive fashion.
Page Reference: The reflections on the process of involving wearers in design are crucial for understanding how co-design can impact both short- and long-term shifts in the fashion and design industry​(4).
Example: Short-term: Immediate improvements in prosthetic fashion design for wearers. Long-term: Potential to establish new paradigms for inclusive design in broader fashion sectors and public policy.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary stakeholders include prosthetic users, fashion designers, and the disability community. Secondary stakeholders include policymakers in inclusive design, healthcare professionals, and educational institutions promoting inclusive design studies.
Page Reference: The engagement with both prosthetics professionals and wearers throughout the design process is essential in ensuring a user-centered approach​(4).
Example: Designers benefit from new methods of inclusive fashion, while wearers of prosthetics directly benefit from tailored designs that reflect their identities.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: This research deeply influences the field of fashion design by advocating for a more inclusive approach. It also has broader impacts across disability studies, design education, and healthcare sectors.
Page Reference: The strong interdisciplinary connection between fashion and prosthetic design highlights the broad applicability of the research​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Deep impact: Redefines disability-inclusive fashion design. Broad impact: Can inspire changes in how other industries, such as healthcare and education, approach design for individuals with disabilities.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research demonstrates high scalability by showing how fashion principles can be applied to disability-inclusive design across different regions. It also has transferability, as the methods used could be adapted for other forms of wearable technologies.
Page Reference: The participatory approach used in fashion design for prosthetics offers valuable insights that could be transferred to other fields like healthcare, enabling personalized solutions​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The techniques used in co-designing prosthetics could be scaled to other regions or transferred to designing other assistive devices, like mobility aids.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces a disruptive innovation by merging fashion with prosthetic design, which is traditionally viewed as a purely functional endeavor. It encourages the involvement of wearers in the design process, potentially disrupting how prosthetics are traditionally designed and marketed.
Page Reference: The integration of fashion-led design with participatory methods in prosthetics challenges traditional design norms​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The innovative merging of fashion and prosthetics could disrupt both industries, leading to prosthetics that are not only functional but also expressive of the wearer’s identity.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations are central to this research, particularly the need to involve wearers in the design process ("Nothing About Us Without Us"). This approach ensures that the designs are not only functional but also aligned with the personal needs and identities of the wearers.
Page Reference: The ethical implications of excluding wearers from the design process are discussed extensively​(4).
Example: The involvement of wearers in the design of their prosthetics ensures ethical practices in design, addressing both personal and societal sustainability.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The designs created through this research are highly usable, as they are co-designed with wearers, ensuring they meet the needs and preferences of the target users.
Page Reference: The participatory nature of the project ensures that the final products are both functional and personally meaningful to the users​(4).
Example: The co-designed prosthetics are more likely to be adopted and used effectively by the wearers, enhancing their quality of life.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research integrates concepts from fashion design, disability studies, and participatory design, making it relevant across multiple disciplines. Its emphasis on inclusivity and co-design has global relevance in promoting disability rights.
Page Reference: The intersection of fashion and healthcare ensures that the research can be applied globally, particularly in regions seeking to adopt more inclusive design practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The co-design approach used in this research can be adapted globally to improve prosthetic design and other assistive technologies, enhancing their appeal and usability across different cultures.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research shows adaptability by engaging diverse stakeholders and incorporating their feedback into the design process, which is vital for creating sustainable and resilient prosthetics that can evolve with changing user needs.
Page Reference: The iterative nature of the design process ensures that the products remain adaptable to future advancements in both fashion and healthcare​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research’s resilience lies in its flexibility to adapt to new materials and user preferences, ensuring that the prosthetics remain relevant and effective over time.
This detailed analysis covers the impact of the study across the top 10 dimensions, providing practical examples of how the research could influence various sectors, both immediately and in the long term.
