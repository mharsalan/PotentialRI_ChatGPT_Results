Based on a thorough reading of the attached study "Invisible Belfast: Flat ontologies and remediation of the post-conflict city" and aligning with the predefined research impact dimensions, here are the detailed potential research impacts organized by relevant types:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Urban and Cultural Studies: The study enhances academic discourse by blending concepts from urban studies, philosophy (Object-Oriented Ontology), and media studies. It introduces alternate reality games (ARGs) as a method for understanding post-conflict cities. This interdisciplinary approach could pave the way for future research in post-conflict narratives, digital storytelling, and urban identity in academic literature.
Innovation in Media Studies: It adds new dimensions to transmedia storytelling by incorporating ARGs, which can stimulate further theoretical development in media and game studies.
Influence on Philosophy: The study applies Object-Oriented Ontology to urban landscapes, offering new ways of thinking about cities beyond human-centric perspectives. This could influence philosophical debates about space, objecthood, and materiality (Common Research Impact …).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation and Heritage: The research preserves Belfast's historical narrative by remediating its post-conflict identity through interactive media formats. It promotes public engagement with the city’s past and present through games, novels, and documentaries. This contributes to broader cultural preservation efforts by making history accessible and engaging​(Research impact toolkit).
Social Cohesion and Understanding: By exploring the post-conflict narrative of Belfast, the study enhances social understanding and cohesion. It provides a novel way for people, especially younger generations, to engage with the city’s history, potentially reducing sectarian divides through shared cultural experiences​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Urban Policy and Redevelopment: Insights from the research could inform urban planning and cultural heritage policies, particularly in cities recovering from conflict. It highlights the importance of integrating cultural narratives into city planning, potentially guiding policy on urban renewal and historical preservation​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cultural Policy: The research could influence policy decisions regarding the funding and promotion of digital media and transmedia storytelling in post-conflict settings, supporting community-led cultural initiatives.
4. Technological Advancement
Innovation in Interactive Media: The use of ARGs in the study advances technology by combining interactive storytelling with urban studies. This could lead to technological innovations in educational tools, tourism, and public engagement through gamified experiences of urban history​(Common Research Impact …).
Potential for Technological Commercialization: The success of ARGs in engaging with urban history could lead to the commercialization of similar projects in other cities. Such games can be used for educational tourism or cultural promotion, providing economic benefits through cultural industries​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Public Awareness and Education
Engagement with History: The study’s use of transmedia storytelling to depict Belfast’s post-conflict landscape educates the public about the city’s complex history. It raises awareness of political and social issues through engaging media formats, making the history of conflict accessible and thought-provoking​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Public Engagement: The research fosters greater public involvement in historical and urban studies through interactive platforms, encouraging citizens to actively engage with the city’s narratives. This can be a model for other post-conflict cities seeking to engage their populations in historical reflection​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Economic Impact
Cultural Tourism: The ARG’s focus on the city’s narratives could enhance cultural tourism in Belfast by offering an interactive way to experience the city’s history. This could generate economic benefits by attracting tourists interested in immersive historical experiences​(Research impact toolkit).
Media and Gaming Industry Growth: The use of ARGs and interactive digital media has potential commercial value. This approach could stimulate local economies by creating jobs in the gaming and cultural industries, as well as fostering collaboration between media companies and cultural institutions​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Environmental and Urban Impact
Urban Regeneration: By focusing on the post-conflict remediation of Belfast, the study could influence future urban regeneration projects, encouraging cities to incorporate digital and interactive media into their urban storytelling strategies. This could promote sustainable development that respects and preserves cultural heritage while engaging the public​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Influence on Public Spaces: The research suggests new ways of thinking about public space as interactive and dynamic, fostering community involvement in how cities narrate their own histories. This may encourage local governments to integrate similar methods into urban planning and public engagement initiatives​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Transferability to Other Cities: The research approach can be applied to other cities with complex historical and political identities. By using interactive media to explore historical narratives, other cities can develop similar projects to engage their populations and tourists in meaningful ways​(Common Research Impact …).
International Relevance: Cities around the world grappling with post-conflict identities can adapt the study's methodology, fostering international collaboration in using digital storytelling for urban development and historical reconciliation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Knowledge Dissemination and Communication
Innovative Communication Methods: The study demonstrates how new media, such as ARGs and interactive documentaries, can be used to disseminate historical and cultural knowledge to diverse audiences. This novel approach enhances the communication of complex urban narratives in an engaging, accessible manner​(Research impact toolkit).
Contribution to Public Debates: By presenting Belfast’s history in an interactive format, the study could influence public debates on how cities recover from conflict and present their narratives to the world​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Capacity Building and Training
Training for Media and Game Developers: The project serves as a model for training developers in using ARGs and other interactive tools to address social and historical topics. This can enhance skill development in digital storytelling, game design, and media production within post-conflict contexts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These impacts illustrate the multifaceted influence of the study, ranging from academic and technological advancements to policy influence, economic benefits, and social transformation.
