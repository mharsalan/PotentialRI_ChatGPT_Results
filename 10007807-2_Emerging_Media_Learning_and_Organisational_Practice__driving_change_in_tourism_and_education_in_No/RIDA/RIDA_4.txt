The study titled "Generation Animation: Participatory Action Research and Intergenerational Pedagogy" focuses on using participatory action research (PAR) to create an intergenerational learning environment in Northern Ireland, particularly in a post-conflict, shared education context. Below is an analysis of the study based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The project aimed to make space for children's voices in a specific post-conflict context known as 'Shared Education'... facilitating learning through media practice (animation) as these pupils used the animated screen space to explore the UNICEF Rights of the Child." (Introduction, page 1).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 1.
Example: The study influences the educational domain by improving pedagogical practices in primary education and advancing social domains by fostering inter-community collaboration in a post-conflict region. It also touches the policy domain, influencing shared education strategies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The PAR approach... offers insights and conclusions on the impact of the PAR on the participants and the wider community." (Methodology, page 5).
Page Reference and Section: Methodology, page 5.
Example: The research's impact will have long-term effects on educational approaches in divided communities, as it demonstrates a sustainable model for fostering understanding and shared learning in post-conflict societies.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The PAR enabled the facilitation of learning... primary school pupils, university staff and students, and community teachers all participated." (Context, page 3).
Page Reference and Section: Context, page 3.
Example: The direct stakeholders include primary school pupils and educators in Northern Ireland. Indirect stakeholders are policymakers and educational institutions interested in shared education and community cohesion in divided societies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "This paper offers an examination of the complex pedagogical interplay at work between key participants." (Abstract, page 1).
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 1.
Example: The research has deep impact within educational pedagogy and broad impact across social and cultural domains by influencing intergenerational learning practices and promoting social cohesion in divided communities.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The shared education approach... was highly transferable across other divided communities in Northern Ireland." (Discussion, page 9).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 9.
Example: The methodology is transferable to other post-conflict regions globally, and the use of digital animation as a teaching tool can be scaled to different educational settings.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The project... provided new ways for children to express their understanding of their rights using animation." (Introduction, page 2).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 2.
Example: The use of digital animation in primary education is innovative as it empowers children to engage creatively with social and political issues, potentially disrupting traditional teaching methods in shared education.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The project aligns with UNICEF's Rights of the Child, promoting children's rights through education." (Methodology, page 6).
Page Reference and Section: Methodology, page 6.
Example: The research promotes ethical considerations by focusing on children's rights and sustainability through its long-term impact on community relations in a post-conflict environment.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "Teachers and students were able to apply the animation methods in their classrooms." (Results, page 8).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 8.
Example: The tools and methods developed (digital animation and intergenerational pedagogy) are usable in various educational settings, ensuring practical implementation in classrooms.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "The methodology developed is applicable in educational and social integration programs in other divided communities globally." (Discussion, page 9).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 9.
Example: The study holds cross-disciplinary relevance by integrating media studies, education, and social psychology and has global relevance in addressing post-conflict education and integration.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The project showed adaptability by evolving the learning approach as per the community needs." (Discussion, page 10).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 10.
Example: The project's resilience lies in its flexible methodology, allowing for adjustments based on community and participant feedback, ensuring adaptability in various settings.
This breakdown provides a detailed mapping of the study's contributions across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, reflecting its broad relevance in education, social integration, and community building.
