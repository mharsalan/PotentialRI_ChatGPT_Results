3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The investigation is performed for an assembly of a finite number of unit cells... subjected to external harmonic loading" (p. 4)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 4​(1).
Example: Direct stakeholders include medical device manufacturers and biomedical engineers working on stent design and deployment, while indirect stakeholders are patients receiving cardiovascular interventions that benefit from improved stent technologies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The Bloch–Floquet analysis is also used to obtain the deformation modes of the stented blood vessel in the time-harmonic pulsation regime" (p. 2)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 2​(1).
Example: The study has deep impact in the field of biomechanics by introducing advanced modeling techniques (Bloch–Floquet analysis) and broad impact across engineering disciplines, affecting fluid dynamics and structural mechanics studies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Several investigations were conducted to determine the resonant frequencies and wave propagation in such systems, with and without fluid" (Introduction, p. 2)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 2​(1).
Example: The study’s methods are highly scalable to various cardiovascular applications, with potential transferability to other fluid-structure interaction systems, such as aerospace or automotive engineering fluid dynamics.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The Bloch–Floquet approach is a useful technique to analyze the behavior of periodic systems... constituting a novel approach for detecting reflected waves in arteries" (p. 3)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 3​(1).
Example: The research introduces an innovative computational model for wave propagation analysis in biomedical contexts, potentially disrupting traditional methods of stent design and influencing future medical innovations in cardiovascular treatments.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Reflection of waves in blood vessels is a well-known phenomenon but... linked to strong geometrical changes such as branching of vessels" (Introduction, p. 2)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 2​(1).
Example: The study contributes to the sustainability of healthcare practices by proposing improved stent designs, leading to fewer complications and longer-lasting medical interventions, thereby reducing the need for repeat surgeries and minimizing resource use in the healthcare system.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The deployed stent structure consists of the repetition of several unit cells along the axis of the vessel" (p. 3)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 3​(1).
Example: The practical insights into stent design can directly influence the usability of stents in clinical settings, making the findings highly implementable in medical device manufacturing and clinical practice.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Wave propagation in fluid-filled cylinders has been extensively investigated in the literature... and is suitable for a very broad range of applications" (Introduction, p. 2)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 2​(1).
Example: The research has global relevance across biomedical engineering, mechanics, and applied mathematics, influencing cardiovascular research and fluid dynamics studies globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The transient regime analysis shows how the flow is affected by the reinforcements" (p. 4)​(1).
Page Reference: p. 4​(1).
Example: The study addresses adaptability in medical devices, demonstrating how stent structures can accommodate various physiological conditions and offer resilience against arterial blockages, reducing restenosis risks.
