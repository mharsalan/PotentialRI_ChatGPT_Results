Section Reference: Discussion, page 6
Example: This research demonstrates long-term impact by providing a foundation for future diagnostic innovations in detecting pneumococcal disease, influencing clinical diagnostics and vaccine development over time.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpts: "The diagnostic samples used in this research were obtained with approval from the Nottingham Research Ethics Committee." (Methods, page 7)
Section Reference: Methods, page 7
Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare providers and public health institutions, who benefit from improved diagnostics. Indirect stakeholders include the general public, who benefit from better vaccine coverage and disease monitoring.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: "Using a panel of urine specimens from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia or pneumococcal disease, the overall clinical sensitivity of this version of the assay... is 94.3 %." (Results, page 3)
Section Reference: Results, page 3
Example: The research has a deep impact on pneumococcal disease diagnostics, revolutionizing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for clinical use.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: "This UAD assay offers the capacity for further development with the introduction of novel anti-pneumococcal serotype-specific mAbs." (Discussion, page 6)
Section Reference: Discussion, page 6
Example: The assay’s design allows for scalability to detect various pneumococcal serotypes in broader patient populations. It also exhibits transferability across different clinical sample types (blood, CSF, pleural fluid).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: "The UAD v.2.1 assay was able to detect pneumococcal antigen in 83 (94.3 %) of the urine samples from these patients and generate serotype information from 75 of the 83 urine samples." (Results, page 5)
Section Reference: Results, page 5
Example: This research introduces innovative diagnostic techniques that enhance the accuracy of identifying pneumococcal infections, potentially disrupting traditional culture-based methods.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: "The diagnostic samples used in this research were obtained with approval from the Nottingham Research Ethics Committee." (Methods, page 7)
Section Reference: Methods, page 7
Example: The research adheres to ethical standards by ensuring that diagnostic samples are ethically sourced, promoting transparency and responsibility in clinical research.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: "This UAD assay offers the capacity for further development with the introduction of novel anti-pneumococcal serotype-specific mAbs." (Discussion, page 6)
Section Reference: Discussion, page 6
Example: The assay is designed for clinical usability, providing healthcare professionals with a practical tool for diagnosing pneumococcal disease with higher sensitivity.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: "The introduction of the PCV-7 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine... has helped to reduce the overall incidence of pneumococcal disease." (Introduction, page 2)
Section Reference: Introduction, page 2
Example: This research is globally relevant as it informs public health strategies on pneumococcal vaccination, impacting both clinical diagnostics and vaccine policy internationally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: "The assay could be used to identify pneumococcal antigens in other clinical samples such as blood, CSF, and pleural fluid." (Discussion, page 6)
Section Reference: Discussion, page 6
Example: The research demonstrates adaptability by suggesting the application of the assay to various types of clinical samples, ensuring its utility across different medical conditions and patient types.
