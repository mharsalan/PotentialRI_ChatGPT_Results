Section: Results, page 424.

Example: Direct stakeholders include crystallographers and bioinformaticians who benefit from more accurate and faster classification of protein crystallization images. Indirect stakeholders may include pharmaceutical companies using protein structures to develop drugs.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

“As crystallization experiments produce a continuum of results rather than discrete outcomes… the identification of crystals is the main aim.” This demonstrates the deep impact on the field of protein crystallography​(2).
Section: Introduction, page 418.

Example: The research has a deep impact by introducing a novel approach for image classification in a specific domain (structural biology). Broadly, it could affect various industries reliant on protein crystallography, such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The generic nature of the ALICE software is noted: “Our software, ALICE, is designed to be generic software that can be adapted to many different systems available.” This highlights its scalability and potential for broader application​(2).
Section: Introduction, page 418.

Example: The software can be scaled up to analyze larger datasets in high-throughput crystallography labs globally. Its transferability lies in its potential to be adapted for different imaging systems beyond crystallography.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The combination of Fourier descriptors and object-based methods “dramatically improves the classification rate for crystals” and challenges traditional single-method approaches​(2)​(2).
Section: Results, page 424.

Example: The study introduces an innovative combination of two image analysis methods, potentially disrupting standard practices in automated crystallography by setting a new benchmark for accuracy and efficiency in classifying crystal images.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The research indirectly promotes sustainability in drug discovery by improving the efficiency of protein structure determination, which can lead to quicker development of life-saving drugs​(2).
Section: Discussion, page 424.

Example: By improving crystallization processes, the research supports sustainability in healthcare through more efficient drug development, reducing the time and resources required for structural determination in pharmaceutical research.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research describes a practical application in the form of software (ALICE), which can be implemented across different crystallography labs. The use of this software in structural biology labs exemplifies its high usability​(2).
Section: Introduction, page 418.

Example: ALICE can be implemented in laboratories with existing imaging systems, providing immediate utility in automating image classification processes in crystallography.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

“As structural genomics centers use robotic systems… the results must be assessed repeatedly over time.” This indicates the global relevance of the research in accelerating structural biology and drug discovery​(2).
Section: Introduction, page 418.

Example: The software can be used in structural genomics projects worldwide, crossing disciplines like computational biology, bioinformatics, and structural chemistry.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

“The Fourier method is more accurate for images that are consistent throughout the drop… but suffers from high rates of false negatives.” This highlights the adaptability of the approach, which can be adjusted depending on the type of images analyzed​(2).
Section: Results, page 424.

Example: The dual-method approach is adaptable and resilient to different types of crystallization images, making it useful in various experimental setups where image quality and conditions vary.
