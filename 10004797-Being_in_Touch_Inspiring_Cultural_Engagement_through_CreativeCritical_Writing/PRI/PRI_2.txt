Based on the document titled "Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions" and the guidance provided across various research impact frameworks, here are the Research Impact Dimensions relevant to the attached study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study’s impact could be observed across multiple domains, including:

Academic domain: Contributions to knowledge, advancing theories or methodologies within the study’s specific field.
Social domain: If the study addresses social issues or has implications for public policy or community well-being, it may influence how individuals or organizations act or make decisions.
Economic domain: If the study leads to innovations, product development, or economic savings, it could impact industries or economies.
Environmental domain: Should the research involve sustainability or ecological impact, the findings may contribute to environmental policy or practice improvements.
Example: A sociological study might raise awareness of public issues and influence both policy and individual behaviors, such as a study on social media and mental health affecting both policy regulations and social awareness.

2. Duration of Research Impact
The research may have both:

Short-term impacts, such as immediate changes in practice, decision-making, or policy applications.
Long-term impacts, where the findings continue to influence research, societal practices, or technologies over an extended period.
Example: Immediate uptake of the research by healthcare professionals may occur in a study developing new public health strategies, while long-term impacts might arise through shaping future research directions or influencing government health policies.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Identifying key stakeholders who would benefit from the study:

Researchers: Future studies may build upon the research outcomes, advancing the field.
Policymakers: If the research is related to societal or environmental issues, policymakers might use the data to inform regulations or reforms.
Industry professionals: If technological or procedural innovations are involved, businesses or sectors could incorporate the findings into their practices.
General public and community groups: Particularly if the study addresses public health, social justice, or educational reforms, broader societal groups could experience benefits.
Example: A study focused on educational inequalities might result in policy changes benefitting schools, teachers, and students, particularly in underserved communities.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep impact: If the research introduces significant changes or advances in its specific field, it could reshape how the field operates or progresses.
Broad impact: The research might influence multiple fields or sectors if it crosses disciplinary boundaries.
Example: A study on technological advancements in renewable energy might deeply affect energy policy, while also broadly impacting sectors such as transportation, manufacturing, and environmental science.

5. Scalability and Transferability
The research’s findings could be scaled to larger populations or transferred across different industries or fields.

Scalability: Research that proves successful in a small sample might be applied more widely across regions or industries.
Transferability: Insights or methods from the research could be adapted for use in other disciplines.
Example: A medical intervention study might be piloted in one region and then scaled nationally or internationally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The research could:

Introduce innovations: By presenting new ideas, methodologies, or technologies.
Disrupt traditional approaches: If the research challenges existing paradigms or presents more efficient solutions to common problems.
Example: A disruptive study might involve developing a novel AI-based diagnostic tool for healthcare, transforming traditional diagnostic processes.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Research may contribute to:

Sustainability: Enhancing environmental, social, or economic sustainability practices.
Ethical standards: Ensuring that the research adheres to ethical guidelines, such as promoting fairness, equity, or environmental stewardship.
Example: Research on reducing carbon emissions in manufacturing processes would have both environmental and ethical impacts by promoting sustainability and corporate responsibility.

8. Implementation and Usability
Practical application of research findings in real-world settings:

Usability: The ease with which research findings can be implemented by policymakers, professionals, or industries.
Example: A study that results in a low-cost diagnostic tool for healthcare settings in underserved regions would have a high usability factor, improving access to care.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
If the research integrates knowledge across multiple fields, or addresses global challenges, such as climate change or public health crises, its impact might be relevant across borders.

Example: A study on antimicrobial resistance would have global implications, influencing public health policy worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The research remains relevant and impactful even as conditions change.
Adaptability: The findings can be adapted to new challenges or changing societal needs.
Example: Research on public health interventions might adapt to address future pandemics or healthcare crises, showing both resilience and adaptability in practice.

These dimensions collectively frame the potential impact of the study across multiple sectors, timescales, and disciplines. By considering each of these dimensions, researchers can better plan for and communicate the wide-ranging effects of their work.
