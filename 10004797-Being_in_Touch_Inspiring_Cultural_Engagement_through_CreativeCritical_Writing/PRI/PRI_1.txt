
Based on the provided text from the file, here are Research Impact Pathways that would help achieve the potential impacts of the study both before and after publication:

Pre-publication Pathways
Capacity Building and Training
Workshops and Conferences: Prior to the publication, organizing workshops with creative writers, poets, and literary theorists to introduce the concept of tactile poetics could build a foundation for collaborative exploration. Such capacity-building initiatives will not only educate others but also refine the research through feedback.
Example: Facilitating a pre-publication event in partnership with academic institutions, targeting both budding and established writers to explore the applications of sensory writing and touch in literature.
Stakeholder Engagement
Engaging Literary Communities: By engaging literary communities, including writing groups, publishers, and editors, the research can directly influence how literary outputs are shaped. This stakeholder engagement serves as a critical pathway to ensure that the research is relevant and addresses both academic and creative needs.
Example: Discussions with publishers about how tactile poetics can inspire new genres of literature, enabling its integration into new literary markets and creative projects.
Collaboration with Artists
Cross-disciplinary Projects: Establishing partnerships with artists and visual storytellers to explore how tactile poetics can extend beyond traditional writing formats and inspire innovative art forms (e.g., performance art, sensory installations). This collaboration can form a productive pathway that generates early interest and wider dissemination opportunities across various disciplines.
Example: Joint projects with galleries to create interactive installations where tactile poetics are performed or displayed as part of artistic showcases.
Post-publication Pathways
Knowledge Dissemination

Academic and Public Lectures: After the research is published, presenting findings at academic conferences and public forums will increase its visibility among scholars and writers. This will also provide the opportunity to demonstrate the practicality of tactile poetics, engaging broader audiences including educators and students.
Example: Organizing public talks in literary festivals or guest lectures in university literature programs to discuss how tactile poetics could change narrative techniques and reader engagement.
Policy Influence and Advocacy

Incorporating Tactile Poetics into Education: Post-publication, advocating for the integration of tactile poetics into creative writing curricula at universities and art schools. This policy-influence pathway ensures the research has long-term impacts in shaping how creative writing is taught, emphasizing sensory experience in writing.
Example: Working with curriculum developers to include the study of tactile poetics in both undergraduate and postgraduate creative writing programs.
Media Outreach and Social Media

Leveraging Media Platforms: Utilizing media platforms, such as academic journals, podcasts, social media, and literary blogs, to discuss the research findings. This outreach is key in popularizing the concept of tactile poetics, extending the research’s impact beyond the academic world into mainstream media and cultural discussions.
Example: Collaborating with literary magazines and podcasts that focus on innovative writing techniques to feature the study, making it accessible to a larger, non-academic audience.
Innovation and Disruption in Literary Techniques

Inspiring New Genres: The research could lead to innovations in creative writing and the development of new literary genres that emphasize tactile experiences. Such disruptions in traditional narrative techniques can inspire writers globally to rethink how they craft their works, potentially leading to the creation of new literary movements.
Example: Post-publication, the research could inspire anthologies or competitions that focus on tactile poetics, challenging writers to experiment with this approach in fiction, poetry, and essays.
Interdisciplinary Impact and Technological Application

Collaboration with Digital Literature: Working with technologists and digital platforms to apply tactile poetics in interactive storytelling. This pathway could expand the study’s impact by introducing it into virtual and augmented reality platforms where touch and sensory experiences are integral.
Example: Collaborating with developers of VR or immersive narrative platforms to create experiences that utilize tactile poetics, blending digital storytelling with sensory engagement.
Long-term Impact Pathways
Sustainability through Academic Contributions

Citations and Follow-up Research: The long-term impact of the research will be sustained by its inclusion in subsequent academic studies. By positioning tactile poetics as a foundational framework for exploring sensory writing, it ensures that future scholars build upon the research.
Example: Follow-up studies by other researchers that expand on tactile poetics in different cultural, linguistic, or artistic contexts, ensuring the concept’s ongoing academic relevance.
Cultural Impact and Public Engagement

Book Publishing and Reader Engagement: Publishing books that incorporate tactile poetics can enhance reader engagement and contribute to the broader cultural impact by making sensory experience a more central component of literature. Book readings, signing events, and interactive reader sessions will also foster public participation.
Example: Launching a series of interactive literary events where tactile poetics are demonstrated, involving audience participation to experience the ‘touch’ within the narrative.
By following these pathways, the research can achieve a broad and lasting impact, influencing academic discourse, creative practices, public engagement, and interdisciplinary innovation.
