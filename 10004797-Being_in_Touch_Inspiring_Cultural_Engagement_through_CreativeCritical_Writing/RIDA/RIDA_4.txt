ous dimensions of research impact, providing detailed definitions and examples for each. Here’s a summary of the key dimensions that can be assessed in your study, aligning with the provided framework:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

This dimension assesses the various sectors impacted by the research (e.g., academic, economic, environmental, health, policy, etc.). Examples:
Research on climate change could have environmental, policy, and economic impacts by influencing global agreements and green technologies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The impact can be short-term (immediate adoption of findings) or long-term (fundamental shifts in the field over time). Examples:
Long-term impacts could be seen in foundational research like Einstein's theory of relativity, while short-term impacts might arise from rapid technological innovations in response to crises like COVID-19.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Stakeholders include researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, community groups, and the public. Examples:
A study on healthcare delivery could impact medical professionals directly and the general public indirectly by improving health outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

This dimension focuses on whether the research has a deep impact within one field or a broad influence across multiple fields. Examples:
Deep impact: A breakthrough in gene editing (CRISPR) reshaping biotechnology.
Broad impact: Research on artificial intelligence influencing healthcare, finance, and education.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

Scalability refers to whether research can be expanded, and transferability refers to its applicability in other fields. Examples:
A solar energy innovation that starts at a community level but can be scaled to a national energy grid, or transferable technologies like machine learning being applied to medical imaging.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

This dimension measures the ability of the research to introduce new concepts or disrupt existing paradigms. Examples:
Disruptive technologies like quantum computing could replace classical computing systems across industries.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Research impacts society when it contributes to sustainable practices and adheres to ethical standards. Examples:
Research in sustainable agriculture or AI systems that prioritize ethical considerations like fairness in algorithmic decision-making.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

This dimension looks at how readily the research can be applied in real-world settings and by different stakeholders. Examples:
A study on renewable energy solutions that is easily adopted by industries and governments for cleaner energy production.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

Research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and is relevant globally. Examples:
Studies on climate change mitigation are globally relevant and span multiple fields, including science, policy, and economics.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

This refers to the research’s ability to adapt over time or be resilient in the face of changing conditions. Examples:
Research in healthcare systems that remains adaptable in crises like pandemics.
These dimensions provide a comprehensive way to evaluate the potential impacts of your study across different sectors, stakeholders, and timeframes. Let me know if you'd like more specific insights on any particular dimension.
