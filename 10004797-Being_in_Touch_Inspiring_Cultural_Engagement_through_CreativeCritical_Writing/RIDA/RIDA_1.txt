Based on the text from the file you provided, here is an overview of the Research Impact Dimensions for your study, aligned with my predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: The study primarily impacts the academic domain by contributing to the fields of creative writing, poetics, and literature, specifically in how writing can touch and make contact both physically and metaphorically. It enriches the understanding of how tactile qualities can be translated into literary works.

Example: This research can influence future studies in creative writing and poetics, particularly those examining the sensory and material aspects of language. It could also impact the teaching of creative writing by offering new ways to think about the sensory experiences of readers and writers.
Cultural Domain: The study crosses into the cultural domain by exploring how literature can shape and be shaped by sensory experiences, thereby influencing creative practices in writing and art.

Example: This research can inspire writers and artists to incorporate more sensory and tactile elements into their work, thereby influencing cultural productions in literature and other forms of art.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: The study’s immediate impact lies in its ability to shift how creative writing is approached, particularly in relation to touch and sensory experience. It might quickly be adopted by educators and writers looking to explore new forms of expression.

Example: Theoretical courses on poetics and creative writing might integrate these insights into their curriculum within a short timeframe, leading to changes in how students are taught to think about language and touch.
Long-term Impact: In the long term, this study could contribute foundational knowledge to future research in creative and literary practices, influencing broader fields like philosophy, art history, and sensory studies.

Example: Over time, the tactile theory of poetics may shape new genres of creative writing and impact artistic movements that seek to emphasize materiality and sensory experience in their works.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Writers, literary scholars, and educators in creative writing programs are the primary direct stakeholders. These groups can use the findings to develop new writing techniques and educational strategies.

Example: Creative writing educators might incorporate this research into workshops that focus on the materiality of language, enhancing the sensory depth of students' creative outputs.
Indirect Stakeholders: Readers and the broader public interested in literature and the arts also benefit indirectly as this research could influence how literature is consumed and appreciated, particularly in terms of sensory engagement.

Example: Readers may begin to seek out literature that offers richer, more tactile experiences, influencing publishing trends in literary fiction.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: This research could have a profound impact within the niche field of poetics and creative writing studies, particularly in how it redefines the sensory role of language.

Example: It may deeply influence a specific subset of creative writers and scholars who are focused on the interplay of language and the senses.
Broad Impact: While the primary impact is deep within creative writing and poetics, the research also has the potential to broadly influence other fields, including visual arts, performance art, and sensory studies.

Example: The concepts could be applied in interdisciplinary projects, such as art installations or performances that explore the boundaries of touch and language.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The research findings can be scaled within educational systems, reaching a broader audience as the ideas are adopted into creative writing and literary theory curricula globally.

Example: The tactile poetics model might be included in creative writing programs across different universities, impacting how literature is taught on a large scale.
Transferability: The research has high transferability across disciplines like philosophy, cognitive science, and visual arts, where the concepts of touch and materiality are also explored.

Example: In visual arts, these concepts could be used to develop new approaches to sculpture or installation art that emphasize sensory experience.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a novel approach to understanding literature through the sense of touch, offering new methodologies for both writers and literary scholars.

Example: It innovates the field of poetics by introducing tactile elements into the analysis and creation of texts, encouraging writers to think of their work in physical, sensory terms.
Disruption: This research has the potential to disrupt traditional approaches to literary criticism and creative writing, particularly those that prioritize visual or auditory elements over tactile experiences.

Example: It could lead to a paradigm shift where creative writing is no longer seen solely as a linguistic or auditory practice but as a multi-sensory one.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: In terms of social sustainability, this research encourages a holistic understanding of sensory experiences in literature, which can contribute to more inclusive and diverse creative practices.

Example: Writers from marginalized backgrounds might use this framework to explore sensory aspects of their own cultural practices, creating a more inclusive literary landscape.
Ethical Considerations: The research encourages ethical engagement with the body and sensory experiences, promoting practices that respect the physical and emotional boundaries of both writers and readers.

Example: By focusing on non-invasive forms of “touch,” the study advocates for creative practices that honor the consent and autonomy of readers and audiences.
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability: The tactile poetics model can be easily implemented in creative writing workshops, literature courses, and even interdisciplinary studies in sensory arts.
Example: Educators might create exercises where students write with a focus on how their language can evoke sensory experiences, applying the concepts of this research directly in classrooms.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The study has relevance across multiple disciplines, including literature, art, philosophy, and cognitive science, as it opens up new avenues for exploring the sensory dimensions of language.

Example: Cognitive scientists interested in the sensory experience of language could collaborate with literary scholars to explore how reading tactile texts affects the brain.
Global Relevance: The research can influence global creative practices, particularly in regions where tactile and sensory experiences play a key role in artistic expression.

Example: In cultures where touch is an integral part of communication, this research might lead to new literary forms that reflect these sensory experiences.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The tactile poetics model is adaptable to different literary and creative traditions, ensuring its relevance across time and cultural contexts.

Example: This framework can be adapted for use in digital literature, where touch and interactivity can be explored in new ways.
Adaptability: As the concept of touch and tactility evolves with technology (e.g., virtual reality), this research can be adapted to new forms of creative expression.

Example: The rise of immersive media and VR can incorporate tactile poetics, where readers interact with texts in virtual environments.
This breakdown highlights the potential impact across multiple dimensions and the ways in which the research can shape the future of creative writing, artistic practices, and interdisciplinary studies.
