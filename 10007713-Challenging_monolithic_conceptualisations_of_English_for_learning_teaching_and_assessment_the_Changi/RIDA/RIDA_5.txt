Based on the research paper you provided and aligning it with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is the detailed analysis of the potential research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research targets multiple domains such as social, educational, and policy domains. It highlights the social and economic barriers that prevent underrepresented communities from progressing into higher education, and it engages with the wider community, including role models, to mitigate these barriers​(5).
Page Reference: Results, page 1​(5).
Example: The research contributes to the educational domain by informing higher education outreach activities that normalize HE in disadvantaged communities. It also affects the social domain by influencing societal norms and practices regarding educational access.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research focuses on long-term changes in the culture of higher education outreach. The use of role models and community-based approaches is seen as a sustainable strategy to influence students' perspectives over time​(5).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 1​(5).
Example: The long-term impact is evident in how it aims to build a stronger culture of higher education in underrepresented communities. This cultural shift can last beyond the program's lifecycle, affecting future generations.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary stakeholders include underrepresented students, their parents, educators, and community leaders. Secondary stakeholders involve policymakers and local employers who participate in the outreach programs​(5).
Page Reference: Methods, page 3​(5).
Example: Direct stakeholders such as students benefit from mentorship and guidance, while indirect stakeholders like employers gain from a more educated workforce in the future.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research deeply impacts the educational field by developing new approaches to widening participation (WP). It also has broad implications, influencing community-based organizations and educational policymakers​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference: Results, page 3​(5).
Example: The depth of the impact is seen in the development of mentoring models that change individual student outcomes, while the breadth spans multiple sectors, from education to employment.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The program’s approaches, particularly community-based outreach and role model engagement, are scalable and can be adapted to different regions with similar challenges​(5).
Page Reference: Results, page 4​(5).
Example: The role model strategy can be scaled to different areas facing educational disadvantage, and the mentoring approach can be transferred to different educational contexts, such as rural vs. urban settings.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The use of "youth and learner voice" and the implementation of highly contextualized WP is an innovative approach, disrupting traditional outreach practices that may not be as effective for these communities​(5).
Page Reference: Results, page 2​(5).
Example: The disruption occurs in how higher education is presented, moving away from institutional settings to community-centered outreach, which could become a new norm in WP practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The community-based approach, which includes role models and mentoring, is framed as a sustainable method of intervention. The inclusion of "learner voice" also ensures that the program is ethical, as it respects the perspectives and needs of the students​(5).
Page Reference: Methods, page 3​(5).
Example: The sustainability lies in building community capacity for supporting higher education, ensuring that interventions continue beyond the immediate program.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The program’s focus on embedding practices within communities, along with practical interventions like role models and mentoring, ensures high usability. The research findings are immediately applicable to designing future outreach strategies​(5).
Page Reference: Methods, page 5​(5).
Example: Community-based role model programs can be easily implemented in other regions or contexts to improve educational outcomes for underrepresented groups.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: This research crosses into social sciences, education, and policy domains, showing relevance to various sectors beyond education, including public policy and community development​(5).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5​(5).
Example: The global relevance is seen in how the model can inform international approaches to widening participation, especially in regions with similar educational challenges.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research shows adaptability by adjusting outreach practices based on real-time feedback from students and communities. This adaptability is key to the program's success​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Page Reference: Results, page 4​(5).
Example: The resilience is demonstrated by the program’s ability to evolve in response to changing community needs, which makes it effective in diverse and changing environments.
This comprehensive analysis aligns the research with the top 10 dimensions of research impact. Each dimension is demonstrated through practical examples based on the study's outcomes and methodologies.
