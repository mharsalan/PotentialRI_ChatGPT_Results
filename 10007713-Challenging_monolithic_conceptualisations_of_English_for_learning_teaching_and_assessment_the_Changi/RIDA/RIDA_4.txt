Based on the text provided, here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the attached study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "Research can affect multiple domains, such as academic, social, economic, environmental, health, educational, or policy domains."

This study primarily impacts the educational domain, focusing on widening participation in higher education by engaging learners from marginalized backgrounds. The study’s findings could also influence policy by shaping outreach programs and social impacts by promoting social mobility through education.
Page Reference:

This is supported by the realist evaluation approach discussed in pages 189-191 of the attached document, which focuses on educational and community impacts of outreach programs.
Example:

The research influences the educational domain by providing evidence for the efficacy of dedicated progression officers in schools, enhancing students' access to higher education.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Long-term impacts refer to the research's enduring contributions, such as forming the foundation for future research or influencing policy shifts over years."

The study on widening participation provides insights that could have long-term impacts by improving access to higher education for future generations, especially for those in underrepresented communities. It also provides a framework for similar educational programs in different regions.
Page Reference:

The long-term influence of the realist evaluation methodology, including the development of progression theories, is documented on page 191 of the attached study.
Example:

This research has long-term potential by informing future outreach strategies, potentially shaping educational policies to support disadvantaged students across the UK.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Stakeholders can include researchers, industry professionals, policymakers, government bodies, community groups, educational institutions, healthcare providers, or the public."

The main stakeholders of this study are educational institutions, policymakers, and community groups. Schools and colleges benefit directly from improved outreach practices, while policymakers use these findings to address inequalities in higher education access.
Page Reference:

The involvement of community groups and educational institutions is outlined in pages 189-191.
Example:

Policymakers benefit from the study by using its evidence to design more effective educational outreach programs targeting cold spots, areas with low university progression rates.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Deep impact signifies a transformative influence that fundamentally changes or advances a specific area of knowledge."

This study offers a deep impact within the field of widening participation by developing a new conceptual framework for outreach programs. The breadth is reflected in its cross-disciplinary approach, impacting both education and community engagement.
Page Reference:

The broad and deep impacts are highlighted in the focus group analysis on pages 190-191.
Example:

The study’s deep impact comes from its rigorous analysis of the HEPO role in schools, fundamentally advancing our understanding of educational outreach, while its broad impact is seen in its potential to influence national education policies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Research that can be scaled up to affect larger populations or broader geographic areas is considered scalable."

The outreach strategies evaluated in the study can be scaled nationally, and the framework could be transferred to other educational contexts globally, particularly in regions facing similar issues of access and inequality.
Page Reference:

Scalability and transferability are implied through the discussion of outreach programs and community engagement on pages 190-191.
Example:

The program’s success in one area could be scaled to target low participation areas across the UK and adapted for use in other countries with similar educational challenges.
These are the primary research impact dimensions for the study, extracted from the provided text and analyzed according to their relevance to the field of widening participation in education. Let me know if you need more details or further breakdowns of these dimensions!
