Based on the provided document, here is a detailed analysis of the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" for the research study in question:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study addresses multiple domains, such as education and social equity, through the analysis of higher education progression and outreach programs. For instance, "Widening Participation programs" aim to increase access to higher education for disadvantaged students, directly impacting the educational and social domains.

"Widening participation has been framed as a social justice agenda" (p. 190).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 190.
Example: The research impacts the educational domain by influencing policies and practices that support disadvantaged students, helping them access higher education. This also crosses into the social domain by promoting social equity and reducing barriers for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study has both short-term and long-term impacts on widening participation efforts. It highlights immediate benefits, such as improved participation rates and bespoke delivery of educational support, while also contributing to long-term structural changes in educational institutions.

"There has been a significant difference in outcomesâ€¦ better results in terms of participation" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: Short-term impacts include the immediate enhancement of outreach programs, while the long-term impact lies in the institutionalization of Widening Participation (WP) practices that could influence policy and curriculum changes over the coming years.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The key stakeholders affected by the research include educators, students, policymakers, and higher education institutions. WP programs directly benefit students from disadvantaged backgrounds and schools by providing support structures for higher education progression.

"Schools and colleges where HEPOs [Higher Education Progression Officers] partially established a sense of place" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, page 195.
Example: Educators and school staff benefit from professional development, while students gain tailored support to overcome barriers to higher education. Policymakers can also use the findings to adjust national education strategies for widening participation.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research offers deep insights into Widening Participation practices within specific institutions, and it also provides broader implications for national educational policy. By embedding WP staff in schools, the research addresses both institutional cultures and societal factors influencing student progression.

"The HEPO role both reinforced pre-existing cultures of WP and extended it further through the practical support they provide" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: This research has a deep impact on the specific practices of schools involved in the WP program, while its broader impact could shape the national conversation on how to enhance higher education access for disadvantaged students.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The WP programs studied in the research show potential for scalability and transferability, as their success in individual schools could be replicated at a larger scale across different institutions and regions.

"HEPOs have integrated into their institution... yet some noted specific institutional barriers" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: The model of embedding progression officers in schools to support students can be scaled up to other regions or educational systems, potentially influencing national educational policies on student progression.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The introduction of HE Progression Officers (HEPOs) represents an innovative approach to addressing social inequalities in education. By providing dedicated staff for WP, this disrupts traditional roles within schools and colleges, offering more personalized support to students.

"It has been a powerful lever in our widening participation agenda" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: The disruptive potential lies in the way this research advocates for a structural change in how schools approach student support, leading to a possible reevaluation of the roles and responsibilities of school staff.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research emphasizes the ethical imperative of promoting access to education for disadvantaged students, aligning with social justice principles. Additionally, the institutionalization of WP practices ensures the sustainability of such programs in the long run.

"Schools and colleges where HEPOs partially established sense of place" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, page 195.
Example: The program ensures sustainable access to education for underrepresented groups by embedding WP roles within schools, fostering long-term commitment to social equity and educational inclusion.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research is highly implementable, as evidenced by the positive outcomes seen in schools where WP initiatives were fully integrated. This includes the provision of bespoke educational support and a more student-centered approach to guidance.

"The sheer variety of activities offered... particularly adding capacity" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: The successful implementation of HE Progression Officers can be replicated in other schools, making the program highly usable across various educational contexts.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While the study focuses on the UK, its findings regarding educational progression for disadvantaged students have relevance for international efforts to address inequality in higher education access.

"Widening participation becomes framed in contemporary society" (p. 190).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, page 190.
Example: The lessons from this research can inform global educational policy, especially in regions where higher education participation is low among disadvantaged groups, making it cross-disciplinary and globally relevant.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research demonstrates adaptability in addressing institutional challenges within different schools, offering tailored support to meet the unique needs of various student populations.

"HEPO staff... noted contexts that had specific institutional barriers" (p. 195).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, page 195.
Example: The adaptable nature of WP programs ensures that they can be modified to suit different institutional contexts, making them resilient in the face of changing educational landscapes.

These impacts are based on detailed analysis, with practical examples showing how the research can influence policy, practice, and long-term educational outcomes.
