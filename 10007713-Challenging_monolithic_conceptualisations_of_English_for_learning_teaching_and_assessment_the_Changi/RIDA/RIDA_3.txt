Here is a detailed assessment of the research study titled "Supporting Underrepresented Communities to Progress to Higher Education across West Yorkshire: A Realist Evaluation", mapped onto the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact based on the information provided in the study.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study emphasizes the social, educational, and policy domains. It focuses on widening participation (WP) to higher education for underrepresented communities, highlighting social and cultural barriers and addressing how community-based interventions can increase access to higher education.
"WP activity and resources are making a substantive difference to learners across West Yorkshire." (Summary, p. 1) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 1 Example: The research impacts educational policies by informing strategies to engage underrepresented groups in higher education. It also influences community-based outreach efforts by providing insights into what works in WP interventions for disadvantaged youth.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research aims to generate both short-term and long-term impacts, particularly in creating models of WP delivery that can be sustained over time.
"Helping underrepresented communities to progress to higher education is most effective through engaging multiple interventions in relevant spaces at different points in the student life-cycle." (p. 1) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 1 Example: Short-term impacts include immediate increases in engagement with higher education among participants. Long-term impacts involve the formation of new program theories that can be adapted in future outreach initiatives, influencing educational policy over time.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Direct stakeholders include the learners, their communities, parents, educators, and policymakers. The study focuses on how WP initiatives can benefit these groups by improving access to higher education.
"GHWY also engaged extensively with external partnerships in terms of activity and delivery. This has helped in reaching out to wider communities that surround young people including parents, schools and colleges, local organizations and employers." (p. 2) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 2 Example: Parents and educators benefit from the insights generated on how to support young people in progressing to higher education. Policymakers gain valuable data to inform future WP initiatives.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study has both deep and broad impacts. It deeply affects how WP programs are delivered in West Yorkshire, while its findings can be applied broadly across the UK and internationally.
"Analysis of existent Programme Theories points to emergent models of WP delivery, particularly in terms of ‘normalising HE in the community’, ‘role models’ and a deeper consideration of ‘youth and learner voice’." (p. 1) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 1 Example: Deep impact is seen in the refinement of WP delivery models tailored to specific communities. Broad impact comes from the potential to replicate these models in different regions or for different underrepresented groups.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The study suggests that its findings and models of WP can be scaled and transferred to different contexts.
"Innovative delivery models have been formulated based on what our learners and their communities need to consider HE access." (p. 1) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 1 Example: The delivery models can be scaled across other regions in the UK and potentially adapted internationally in similar educational outreach programs.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research presents innovative approaches, especially through the use of role models and experiential learning.
"Experiential Learning: A significant aspect of activity delivery at GHWY Uni Connect is framed around ‘experiential learning’." (Cornerstone Programme Theories, p. 3) Page Reference and Section: Cornerstone Programme Theories, p. 3 Example: By embedding experiential learning into WP programs, the study disrupts traditional educational outreach approaches, making higher education more accessible and appealing to underrepresented learners.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study emphasizes the importance of sustainability in outreach efforts, ensuring that interventions are community-based and respectful of the learners’ voices.
"Interventions need to take a holistic, respectful and community-based approach but, crucially, must do so through the accommodation of learner voice." (p. 1) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 1 Example: The community-driven, learner-focused approach ensures that WP interventions are sustainable and ethically grounded, as they prioritize the needs and voices of the learners.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The study’s findings are immediately implementable in the ongoing and future phases of WP programs.
"We have sought to reconfigure our programme theories through the establishment of Cornerstone Programme Theories." (p. 2) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 2 Example: The WP delivery models developed in the study are practical and can be directly implemented by educators and policymakers working in WP programs.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research draws on various disciplines, including education, sociology, and public policy, making it relevant to a wide range of fields.
"In particular, activities that reached outwards to parents in community spaces were a way of ameliorating such distances." (p. 2) Page Reference and Section: Summary, p. 2 Example: The study's approach to addressing cultural and social barriers to higher education can be applied globally, especially in regions facing similar challenges.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The study shows adaptability by adjusting its program theories based on the needs and feedback of learners and communities.
"There is perhaps an emerging gap regarding the definition of ‘skills’ (or at least, we need to specify what is meant by ‘skills’ in regards to HE entry)." (p. 2) Page Reference and Section: Emerging Gaps/Areas, p. 2 Example: The research is adaptable and responsive, as it continuously refines its approaches based on real-world data and feedback, ensuring its interventions remain effective over time.
These dimensions demonstrate the broad and multifaceted impact of the research in improving access to higher education for underrepresented communities.
