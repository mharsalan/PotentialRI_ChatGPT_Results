Based on the attached study "Inequality Restructured: A Regional Comparison of the Occupational Position of Young People Before and After the Great Recession of 2008" by Kevin Ralston and Adam Formby, I will now assess the research impact dimensions in detail, as aligned with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework. Below, I have mapped the key findings and their relevance to each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The research focuses on occupational inequality among youth in the UK, particularly regional and gendered disparities before and after the Great Recession of 2008. It addresses social, economic, and policy domains.
"We find there has been a reduction in regional inequality in the level of jobs young men and women are doing..." (Results, page 16).
Example: This research impacts the economic and social domains by highlighting the shifting nature of youth employment and contributing to sociological understanding of labor market dynamics. It influences policies on youth employment and social mobility.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The study provides both short-term and long-term impacts by comparing data from 2005-2007 with 2015-2017, offering insights into the decade-long structural changes in youth employment.
“This strategy makes possible assessment of change in occupational circumstance...” (Methods, page 7).
Example: The short-term impact involves addressing immediate labor market outcomes after the recession. The long-term impact is seen in the potential use of this research to inform future labor policies and sociological studies on youth employment across decades.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The primary stakeholders include policymakers, sociologists, and government bodies involved in labor market reforms and youth employment initiatives.
"This analysis challenges governmental claims of a ‘successful’ and ‘thriving’ youth labor market..." (Introduction, page 4).
Example: Policymakers could use the findings to address regional and gender inequalities in employment. The research also benefits youth advocacy groups and social researchers by providing empirical data on occupational shifts.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The study has deep impact within the field of sociology, particularly in youth labor market studies and inequalities.
"Occupational position remains one of the most powerful general indicators of life chances, social and material reward..." (Abstract, page 2).
Example: The depth of impact is evident in the contribution to the sociological understanding of how major economic events like the Great Recession affect youth employment. Its breadth extends to influencing discussions on labor market reforms and youth policies at both local and national levels.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The findings on occupational shifts are transferable across different regions and possibly to other countries experiencing similar labor market challenges.
"This is further evidence that there has been an uplift in average occupational position for men in many regions" (Results, page 18).
Example: The research is scalable to other geographic areas by applying its methods to assess youth employment trends across different nations or regions experiencing post-recession recovery.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The study disrupts the governmental narrative of a successful labor market by providing counter-evidence of the superficial recovery experienced by youth.
"The analysis challenges governmental claims of a ‘successful’ and ‘thriving’ youth labour market..." (Discussion, page 21).
Example: This research holds disruption potential by fundamentally challenging existing narratives around youth labor recovery post-recession, potentially leading to policy reforms that better address the realities faced by young workers.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study does not directly address environmental sustainability but focuses on social sustainability, highlighting long-term labor market inequalities.
"The spatially and demographically unequal nature of unemployment is summed up by Crowley and Cominetti..." (Discussion, page 23).
Example: The ethical consideration in the research lies in addressing socio-economic inequalities, making it relevant for policies aimed at achieving social justice and equitable access to employment opportunities for youth.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research offers practical insights for policymakers by suggesting the need for more equitable labor market policies across regions.
"Our models also account for the gendered nature of the youth labour market and controls for educational attainment levels" (Methods, page 7).
Example: Policy-makers can use the findings to implement region-specific labor reforms that address both gender and educational disparities in youth employment.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

While the study is focused on the UK, the broader themes of occupational inequality and the impacts of economic recession on youth are globally relevant.
"Understanding the UK youth labour market necessitates analysis that involves comprehending which groups of young people are most subject to occupational disadvantage" (Introduction, page 5).
Example: This research could inform global discussions on youth employment, making it relevant for international labor organizations and sociologists studying the impacts of economic crises on youth worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research highlights the resilience of some regions in adapting to post-recession labor market changes, particularly for men, while pointing out the failure of the market to fully recover for women.
"For men, there has been an uplift in several regions that has moved them closer to inner-London..." (Results, page 18).
Example: The study underscores the need for policies that enhance the resilience of the youth labor market, especially in regions where recovery has lagged, emphasizing the importance of regional adaptability to economic shocks.

Each dimension provides critical insights into the multifaceted impact of the research on youth labor markets, offering value for sociological discourse and policymaking on a broad scale.
