Based on the detailed analysis of the attached study and the common research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of the study organized by types of impacts:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge: The study contributes significantly to the field of educational research and specifically the area of widening participation in higher education. It offers new insights into effective outreach programs, such as those using Higher Education Progression Officers (HEPOs), as outlined in the realist evaluation framework.
Methodological Advancement: The application of realist evaluation contributes to the refinement of research methodologies in social sciences and educational evaluation.
Future Research Foundations: The study provides a conceptual framework that can be built upon in future studies related to educational outreach, equity in education, and the long-term societal effects of access to higher education.
2. Policy Impact
Influence on Educational Policy: The study offers evidence-based recommendations for educational policies aimed at improving university access for students from disadvantaged or marginalized backgrounds. Its findings could guide policies related to the allocation of resources for outreach programs and the implementation of support structures in schools.
Policy Advocacy: Through its findings, the study could be used by advocacy groups or policymakers to push for more equitable education policies, particularly regarding funding and support for low-income or underrepresented student groups​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Social and Cultural Impact
Social Equity and Inclusion: The study promotes social inclusion by addressing how outreach programs can mitigate educational inequality. This could have a profound social impact by helping to break the cycle of poverty and promoting social mobility through education​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Behavioral and Attitudinal Change: By demonstrating the effectiveness of outreach programs, the study could influence schools, educators, and communities to adopt practices that encourage higher education aspirations among students who might not have considered it before​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Educational Impact
Improved Educational Practices: The study directly influences educational practices by providing evidence for effective strategies to increase student participation in higher education. Schools and educational institutions could integrate the study's findings to improve their outreach efforts.
Curriculum Design: Findings from the study could be used to design educational curricula that support a more inclusive and equitable approach to higher education​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Economic Impact
Long-term Economic Growth: By increasing access to higher education for disadvantaged students, the study supports efforts to improve employment opportunities, thereby contributing to long-term economic growth. Graduates from underrepresented backgrounds could play a key role in workforce development, leading to economic benefits at both individual and national levels​(Common Research Impact …).
Return on Investment in Education: The study could influence how government funds are allocated to educational initiatives, ensuring that investments in outreach programs yield higher returns in the form of increased university enrolments and graduation rates​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Community and Stakeholder Engagement
Direct Impact on Schools and Local Communities: The involvement of schools and local communities in the study highlights the direct benefits to educators and community groups. Teachers, counselors, and community organizations can use the findings to better support students in their educational journeys​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Engagement of Policymakers and Educational Authorities: The study provides critical evidence that can engage policymakers and educational authorities in discussions about outreach and university access programs, ensuring that resources are directed where they are most needed​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Environmental Impact
Although environmental sustainability is not a direct focus of this study, its emphasis on educational equity and long-term social mobility could contribute to sustainable development goals by fostering education in low-income areas, which can reduce poverty and promote sustainable livelihoods​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Implementation and Usability
Practical Application: The study’s findings can be directly applied by schools and policymakers to design and implement outreach programs that enhance the pathways to higher education for underrepresented students. Its practical recommendations on the role of HEPOs are particularly relevant for educational institutions​(Common Research Impact …).
Scalability: The outreach model evaluated in the study can be scaled and adapted to different regions or countries facing similar challenges in educational access. This transferability makes the research highly useful across various educational contexts​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
9. Health and Well-being Impact
Psychological and Emotional Support: By addressing barriers to higher education, the study indirectly supports the well-being of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, reducing the stress and uncertainty associated with educational progression. This could lead to improved mental health and well-being outcomes for students​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Technological Impact
Potential for Technological Integration: Although not a core focus, the research could influence future technological innovations in education, such as the development of digital tools for outreach and support in higher education​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts illustrate how the study aligns with multiple research impact dimensions and has the potential to generate significant and diverse benefits across educational, social, economic, and policy domains.
