Based on my reading of the study and aligning it with the predefined research impact dimensions, here is a detailed categorization of potential research impacts for the study titled "Supporting Underrepresented Communities to Progress to Higher Education across West Yorkshire: A Realist Evaluation." This classification is structured according to different types of research impacts:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Academic Knowledge and Theories: The study advances the understanding of how widening participation (WP) programs can be more effectively structured, particularly by incorporating experiential learning and community-driven approaches.
"Program theories were formulated through detailed engagement with learners and communities" (p. 3).
This contributes to new theories on WP practices and learner engagement, providing frameworks that future researchers and educators can build upon​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Societal Impact
Reducing Educational Inequality: The study addresses disparities in access to higher education for underrepresented communities, helping to bridge the gap between these groups and higher education institutions. By focusing on community-based interventions and role models, the study promotes social inclusion.
"Activities that reached outwards to parents in community spaces ameliorated the educational distances" (p. 2).
The societal impact is evident in how these interventions lead to greater engagement with higher education among underrepresented groups​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
3. Policy Influence
Informing Education Policy and Widening Participation Strategies: The study provides insights for policymakers on how to structure WP initiatives, particularly those aimed at fostering a supportive ecosystem that involves parents, community organizations, and local schools.
"Insights generated here can inform national education policies and WP strategies across the UK" (p. 4).
Policymakers can use this research to develop more effective strategies to reduce barriers to higher education​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Health and Well-being Impact
Addressing Mental and Social Well-being: The study indirectly contributes to the well-being of learners by improving their access to education, which is closely linked to long-term socio-economic well-being. By empowering communities and learners, it has the potential to reduce stress and increase aspirations, which positively affects mental health and social outcomes​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Cultural and Social Impact
Cultural Inclusion and Role Models: The study emphasizes the importance of "normalizing higher education" within communities, which helps change cultural perceptions around education. By engaging community leaders and role models, the study impacts social norms and aspirations within underrepresented communities​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
"Engagement with community role models has shown significant cultural shifts in how education is perceived by learners" (p. 5).
6. Educational Impact
Innovations in Teaching and Learning: The study introduces new experiential learning models that involve both students and community members in higher education engagement.
"The success of experiential learning activities underscores their potential for adoption in other educational contexts." (p. 3).
This impacts teaching strategies by showing the effectiveness of hands-on, community-oriented learning interventions​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Economic Impact
Potential for Economic Growth through Education: The study addresses long-term economic benefits by increasing access to education, which can enhance workforce skills, reduce unemployment, and promote regional economic growth. By supporting more learners in accessing higher education, there is potential for improved job prospects and economic mobility​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Community Engagement and Participation
Empowering Local Communities: The study involves community engagement as a core element, empowering underrepresented groups to actively participate in the educational process. This leads to greater local ownership of education initiatives and strengthens community cohesion​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
"Community-driven WP activities ensure that local needs are prioritized and addressed." (p. 4).
9. Equity and Inclusivity
Promoting Equity in Education: The study directly tackles educational inequality by targeting groups that are historically marginalized from higher education. It promotes inclusivity by developing tailored interventions that account for cultural, social, and economic barriers.
"Tailored interventions were essential in reaching underrepresented groups and promoting equity in education." (p. 5)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Scalability and Transferability
Potential for Broader Application: The study's models of WP are scalable and transferable to other regions or educational contexts, as they rely on generalizable principles of community engagement and experiential learning.
"The emergent models of WP delivery can be scaled and transferred to similar educational contexts across the UK and internationally." (p. 3)​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Technological and Methodological Innovation
Innovation in Educational Delivery: The use of innovative methods, such as engaging with role models and creating community-focused learning environments, disrupts traditional approaches to WP, introducing more inclusive and context-aware strategies​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Resilience and Adaptability
Sustainable Educational Practices: The study’s approaches are resilient and adaptable to changing educational needs and contexts, particularly as they focus on community involvement and learner voice, which ensures long-term sustainability.
"Through constant learner feedback, WP models were continuously adapted, ensuring relevance and resilience in their impact." (p. 5)​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
13. Public Awareness and Education
Increasing Awareness of Higher Education Pathways: By normalizing higher education in underrepresented communities, the study raises awareness and provides clear pathways for learners to pursue further education, making higher education more accessible.
"Public outreach and engagement campaigns raised significant awareness about higher education opportunities." (p. 2)​(Research impact toolkit).
14. Knowledge Dissemination
Spreading Best Practices in WP: The study has potential to disseminate its findings widely through academic publications, policy briefs, and community workshops, ensuring that its lessons are shared and implemented across various educational settings​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts demonstrate the broad societal, academic, and policy-related benefits that arise from the study, which has the potential to influence higher education practices, community engagement, and equity in education both locally and beyond.
