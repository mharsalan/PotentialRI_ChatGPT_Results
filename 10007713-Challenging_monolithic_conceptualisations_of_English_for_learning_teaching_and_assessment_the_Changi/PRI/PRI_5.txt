Based on the detailed analysis of the research paper you provided, I have identified several potential research impacts aligned with various types of impacts as defined by research impact dimensions. These impacts are categorized based on academic, societal, economic, and other relevant domains:

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: The study contributes significantly to the field of education, particularly in widening participation (WP) and outreach strategies for underrepresented communities. It adds to the academic discourse on how higher education institutions (HEIs) can engage with marginalized populations through role models and community involvement​(5)​(impact pathway).
Interdisciplinary Research: This research bridges education, sociology, and community studies, offering insights that can be used by multiple disciplines to address educational inequity​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Societal and Community Impact
Social Equity and Inclusion: The research addresses social equity by directly engaging with underrepresented students and families in marginalized communities. It aims to close the participation gap in higher education, making it a significant contributor to inclusive education​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Behavioral Change: By involving local role models and community-based interventions, the study influences behavioral changes in perceptions about higher education within these communities, encouraging students to pursue HE as a viable option​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Community Empowerment: The focus on role models and community engagement empowers local communities, giving them a direct role in the educational aspirations of their youth​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy Impact
Influencing Educational Policies: The study can inform policymakers about effective strategies for widening participation, particularly in how HEIs can design outreach programs that are culturally and contextually relevant. This may influence local and national education policies regarding access to higher education​(Research impact toolkit).
Evidence-based Policy-making: The research offers evidence that can be used to craft policies that support sustainable, community-driven outreach programs, potentially influencing government funding and support for such initiatives​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Economic Impact
Economic Benefits through Education: By improving access to higher education for underrepresented communities, the study indirectly contributes to long-term economic benefits. Increased educational attainment in marginalized communities can lead to improved employment rates and economic mobility​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Cost-effectiveness of Outreach Programs: The research demonstrates that community-based outreach, which leverages local role models, can be a cost-effective way to engage disadvantaged communities without the need for expensive traditional marketing or outreach methods​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Cultural and Artistic Impact
Cultural Preservation and Heritage: By integrating local role models and community leaders into educational outreach, the study respects and preserves cultural values, promoting the idea that higher education can coexist with local traditions and community identity​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Health and Well-being Impact
Mental and Emotional Support: The research provides underrepresented students with emotional and mental support through mentorship and role models, which can enhance their overall well-being and reduce the stress associated with accessing higher education​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development: The findings of the study can inform the development of school curricula that include information about higher education pathways and aspirations, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Teaching and Learning Methods: By showcasing how student aspirations can be nurtured through mentorship, the study suggests new methods for teaching that involve community engagement and peer support​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainability of Outreach Models: The research promotes sustainable outreach models by focusing on community-driven initiatives that can continue independently once established, reducing the reliance on external resources​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Technological and Innovation Impact
Use of Technology in Outreach: The study highlights the potential for using technology, such as online platforms and social media, to scale outreach efforts, making educational resources and mentorship accessible to more students in remote or underserved areas​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Application: The study's model of community-based outreach and use of role models can be adapted and applied to other countries and regions facing similar challenges in widening participation in higher education​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Ethical Outreach: The research demonstrates ethical considerations by ensuring that the outreach programs respect the cultural and social context of the communities involved, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Equity and Inclusivity
Promotion of Equity in Education: By targeting underrepresented groups, the study promotes equity in education, ensuring that disadvantaged students have the same opportunities to succeed in higher education as their more privileged peers​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
These potential impacts are aligned with the core dimensions of research impact as outlined in the literature and toolkit guidelines. The study showcases a broad and deep influence on education, society, policy, and economic development, while maintaining a strong focus on inclusivity and community engagement.
