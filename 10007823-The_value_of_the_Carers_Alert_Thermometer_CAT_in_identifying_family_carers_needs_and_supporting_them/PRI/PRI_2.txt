Potential Impact: The research could inform policy changes that reduce disparities in access to services or rights​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Policy Impact
Policy Influence and Advocacy: If the study addresses a topic relevant to policymakers, it could lead to legislative or regulatory changes. The research findings might be used by governments or non-governmental organizations to advocate for new policies or reforms.
Example: The study’s conclusions may influence public policy on social justice, health, or environmental sustainability​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
4. Economic Impact
Economic and Technological Innovation: Should the research involve technology, healthcare improvements, or an industry-related field, there may be economic impacts, such as cost reductions, job creation, or the development of new technologies. Patents, spin-offs, or startup companies could arise from the innovations introduced by the research.
Potential Impact: The research may contribute to economic growth through the development of products or services​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Health and Well-Being Impact
Improvement in Health Outcomes: If the study is related to public health, medicine, or healthcare services, the findings may lead to better health outcomes. For example, it might propose more effective healthcare interventions, leading to better patient care, reduced mortality, or improved life quality.
Example: Clinical practice improvements or new health policies could emerge, directly benefiting patient care​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Environmental Impact
Sustainability Contributions: If the research touches on environmental issues or sustainability, it could contribute to practices that promote environmental conservation or reduce negative environmental impacts. For example, findings could be used to inform policies or practices in resource management, climate change adaptation, or pollution reduction.
Potential Impact: Long-term contributions to environmental sustainability, including practical applications of research findings​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global and Multidisciplinary Collaboration: If the research involves collaboration across multiple fields, it could have a global impact, influencing a wide array of disciplines and contributing to solutions for international challenges. This might be especially relevant if the research addresses global issues like climate change, health crises, or social inequality.
Example: The study could lead to collaborations between researchers in different fields, enhancing its global relevance​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
8. Capacity Building and Training
Development of Skills and Expertise: The study may contribute to the development of skills in future researchers, professionals, or students. By involving stakeholders in the research process, it could also enhance their capacities, thereby strengthening the research community and the workforce.
Example: The research could result in workshops, training programs, or enhanced research methodologies that benefit academic and professional communities​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Technological Advancement and Commercialization
Technological Innovation: Should the research produce a novel technological application, it could be commercialized and lead to the development of new products or industries, further enhancing innovation in the sector.
Potential Impact: Introduction of new technological solutions in healthcare, environmental monitoring, or other relevant fields​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
10. Public Engagement and Communication
Public Education and Engagement: The findings may be disseminated through public lectures, workshops, or media, making complex topics accessible to a non-specialist audience and fostering greater public engagement with the research topic.
Potential Impact: Enhanced public understanding of critical issues, potentially influencing societal behaviors​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These impacts highlight the broad and multidimensional influence that this research could have across academic, societal, policy, economic, and environmental domains. They also demonstrate how the research findings can be effectively integrated into practice to foster long-term benefits.
