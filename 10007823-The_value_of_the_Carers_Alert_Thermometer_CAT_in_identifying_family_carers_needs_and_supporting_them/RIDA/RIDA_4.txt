
Based on the document you provided and aligning with the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions, here is a detailed analysis of the research impact for the study titled "Gaining consensus on family carer needs when caring for someone dying at home to develop the Carers' Alert Thermometer (CAT): a modified Delphi study".

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research impacts multiple domains, primarily the Health and Social Care domains, by addressing the needs of unpaid family carers who care for someone dying at home. It also has implications in Policy and Educational domains by identifying areas for service targeting and staff education to support carers in end-of-life scenarios.
"Development of an alert tool to identify carers’ needs in everyday practice required identification and consensus of the priority areas of need for inclusion." (Introduction, Page 6).
Example: The CAT tool developed in the study will be used in healthcare and social care settings to improve support for carers, leading to better outcomes for both carers and the people they care for. Additionally, it informs educational programs for healthcare professionals, ensuring they are better equipped to assess carer needs.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study has both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term, the CAT tool is immediately applicable in daily practice for carers and healthcare professionals. Long-term, it provides a foundational tool that can evolve with further research and be embedded in health and social care practices.
"The Carers’ Alert Thermometer (CAT) developed from the prioritized areas is an evidence-based, easy-to-use tool to identify carer needs and facilitate discussions with carers." (Conclusion, Page 228).
Example: In the short term, the CAT tool can be adopted by healthcare providers to improve carer support. Over the long term, the research will continue to influence palliative care policy and carer education strategies globally.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The direct stakeholders include unpaid family carers and healthcare professionals (nurses, general practitioners, etc.), while indirect stakeholders encompass policymakers, educational institutions, and future carers.
"The Delphi panels had high levels of agreement and consensus. Ten areas of carer need across two themes of ‘the current caring situation’ and ‘the carer’s own health and well-being’ were prioritized for inclusion in the alert tool." (Results, Page 227).
Example: Family carers benefit directly from having their needs addressed systematically, and healthcare providers benefit from a structured tool to assess these needs. Indirectly, policymakers and educators gain insights into how to better support carer health in policy design and training programs.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research provides deep impact within the domain of palliative care by addressing carer needs comprehensively. It also has broad implications, as it can be adapted to various healthcare and social care settings.
"The prioritized areas from the Delphi provide evidence of the areas to be included in the assessment of carers, targeting of services, and training of staff." (Discussion, Page 228).
Example: The deep impact is evident in the focused improvement on carer assessments within palliative care, while the broad impact comes from the tool's potential adoption across different care settings and its role in reshaping support strategies for carers worldwide.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The CAT tool shows high scalability and transferability. It can be adapted and implemented across various care settings and regions.
"A Delphi approach was chosen to gain agreement from carers and professionals on a prioritized list of carer needs to inform the development of an alert tool to regularly assess needs of carers." (Methodology, Page 230).
Example: The CAT tool can be scaled from local use in individual home care settings to broader applications in national health services. Its transferability allows it to be adapted for different cultural or healthcare systems internationally.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The development of the CAT tool represents an innovation in carer support assessment, offering a structured, evidence-based approach to identifying carer needs in palliative care.
"The Carers’ Alert Thermometer (CAT)... is an evidence-based, easy-to-use tool to identify carer needs and facilitate discussions with carers." (Conclusion, Page 228).
Example: The CAT tool introduces a new way to systematically assess carer needs, disrupting previous ad-hoc approaches and setting a new standard for how carer support is integrated into healthcare practice.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research addresses the sustainability of care at home by focusing on the well-being of carers, ensuring they can continue their caregiving role without detriment to their own health.
"Support for the carer to provide the care needed to the person dying at home and the support carers need to manage their own health and well-being." (Discussion, Page 233).
Example: By ensuring carers' needs are met, the CAT tool promotes sustainable caregiving environments, reducing the risk of burnout and ensuring that carers can provide long-term support ethically and effectively.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The CAT tool was designed with practicality in mind, making it easy to implement in daily practice by healthcare professionals and carers alike.
"The CAT was piloted and went through several consultations exercises with carers and professionals to finalize the question structure." (Final Evidence Review, Page 233).
Example: The user-friendly design of the CAT tool ensures that it can be easily implemented across healthcare settings without requiring extensive training or additional resources.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study’s relevance extends beyond palliative care, touching on areas like mental health, social care, and public health globally.
"Carers can also become socially isolated and removed from their normal lives, with additional challenges such as travelling to provide care." (Background, Page 228).
Example: The tool has global relevance as it can be used in various countries where home-based care is provided, influencing how family carers are supported across different health and social care systems.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The CAT tool is adaptable to different care environments and resilient in its application to varying caregiving circumstances, including those involving chronic conditions or end-of-life care.
"The expert panel commented that the items were very inclusive of carer needs...depending on the individual circumstances." (Round 4 Results, Page 232).
Example: The tool can be adapted to different care settings and conditions, from acute end-of-life care to chronic illness management, making it highly resilient to different caregiving contexts.
