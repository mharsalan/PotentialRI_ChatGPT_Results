Here is the detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study you provided based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The increasing range of treatment options, many with debilitating side effects, are resulting in longer disease trajectories, ensuring a longer period of informal care coupled with anticipatory loss."
(Results, page 636-642)

Impact: The study primarily impacts the health domain by addressing how informal carers manage terminal cancer patients and the associated care burden. It also extends into policy domains, suggesting reforms for carer support in healthcare systems, especially for end-of-life care.

Example:
The study emphasizes the need for interventions that support informal carers, influencing healthcare policies on carer support tools and assessment strategies for those involved in end-of-life care​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Despite patients expressing a desire to die at home, many are admitted to hospitals in the last days of life."
(Discussion, page 641)

Impact: This study has the potential for both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it may lead to immediate changes in how community nurses and palliative care providers assess and manage carer strain. Long-term, the study advocates for continued assessment of carer interventions, which could form the basis for further research into end-of-life care strategies.

Example:
In the short term, it can prompt hospitals to implement carer assessment tools. Long-term, it could influence national policies that improve palliative care models and increase at-home death options​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1).

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The need for developing an assessment tool for carers or an adjunctive to the End of Life Care Programme tools that incorporates regular assessments of carer strain."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact: Stakeholders include healthcare professionals (community nurses, palliative care nurses), policymakers, and informal carers. The study could influence the way care services are structured, impacting both carers and healthcare systems.

Example:
Policymakers could benefit from this study by designing new carer support policies, while healthcare providers could adopt the recommended tools to support carers, improving their practice​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Studies have identified the impact of being a carer and links to physical and mental health, including depression."
(Results, page 636-642)

Impact:
The study has a deep impact on healthcare practices concerning carer support but also a broad impact across multiple sectors, including social welfare and public health. It affects caregiving strategies and end-of-life care policies.

Example:
The research can deeply affect palliative care practices while broadly influencing public health strategies by highlighting the importance of carer well-being​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The study suggests the need for developing a carer assessment tool as an adjunctive to existing tools in the End of Life Care Programme."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact:
The findings from this study are scalable and could be applied at a national level within the healthcare system. The study’s insights into carer strain could be transferred to other areas of chronic illness caregiving, beyond cancer.

Example:
A pilot carer assessment tool could first be used in a few regional hospitals, and then scaled to national healthcare systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "Recommendations for the development of a carer assessment tool with appropriate supportive interventions are made."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact:
The study proposes an innovative solution to a persistent healthcare issue by suggesting a carer assessment tool. This could potentially disrupt current palliative care strategies by introducing regular carer strain assessments into healthcare protocols.

Example:
The introduction of a standardized tool for assessing carer well-being could revolutionize carer support strategies in palliative care​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The need for research to develop an assessment tool for carers...that incorporates regular assessments of the carer strain and is supported by appropriate interventions is clearly required."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact:
This study touches on sustainability in healthcare by promoting long-term support strategies for carers. It also addresses ethical considerations, ensuring that the burden on carers is recognized and managed appropriately, improving the equity of care provision.

Example:
By proposing interventions that sustainably reduce carer strain, the study aligns with ethical healthcare practices, ensuring both patients and carers receive adequate support​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The study advocates for developing carer assessment tools to help identify and manage the burden faced by informal carers."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact:
The research offers practical solutions that are easily implementable in healthcare systems. The suggested carer assessment tool could be integrated into existing healthcare processes with minimal disruption.

Example:
The implementation of these tools in community nursing could improve how carer burden is monitored, helping healthcare providers offer timely support​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1).

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Recommendations for the development of a carer assessment tool...incorporates regular assessments of carer strain."
(Conclusion, page 641)

Impact:
The study’s relevance extends beyond healthcare, impacting social services and policy. The suggested frameworks for carer assessment could be adapted across different sectors and even in different countries dealing with aging populations and chronic illnesses.

Example:
The recommendations could be used globally, especially in aging societies, to improve informal caregiving across healthcare and social support sectors​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The research calls for tools that support informal carers... adapting the existing care models to address carer needs."
(Results, page 636-642)

Impact:
The study addresses the adaptability of healthcare systems by suggesting changes to accommodate the dynamic needs of carers. It promotes resilience in end-of-life care models by ensuring carers have the support they need to continue providing care.

Example:
The research encourages healthcare providers to adapt their care models in response to the growing carer burden, helping to create more resilient healthcare systems that can better handle demographic changes​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .

These dimensions illustrate the far-reaching impact of the study on healthcare, policy, and social systems.
