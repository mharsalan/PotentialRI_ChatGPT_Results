
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions based on the study in the file you provided:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research focuses on unpaid adult carers, improving support systems by providing practical, emotional, and social aid. It addresses key areas such as health and social care systems, and community support (Guideline, page 72).
Section: Overview, Recommendations.
Example: This study enhances the Health Domain by influencing healthcare systems to better accommodate the needs of unpaid carers, impacting policy and care protocols. In the Social Domain, it directly influences societal structures by promoting the recognition and support of unpaid carers.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The guideline's recommendations are expected to have long-term effects by forming foundational strategies for future policies regarding unpaid carers. The research aims at both immediate improvements and sustained societal changes over time (Rationale and Impact, page 73).
Section: Rationale and Impact.
Example: Short-term impacts include immediate improvements in carer support services, such as better access to information and assessments. Long-term impacts include potential shifts in national policies that affect the broader societal treatment of carers.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study targets key stakeholders such as local authorities, healthcare providers, carers, social care organizations, and policymakers (page 72).
Section: Recommendations for Research.
Example: Direct stakeholders include healthcare and social service providers who will use this research to enhance carer support. Indirect stakeholders are unpaid carers themselves, benefiting from improved support services and societal recognition.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: This research has broad implications across multiple sectors—healthcare, social services, and community support systems—while deeply influencing carer recognition policies (page 72-73).
Section: Overview and Recommendations.
Example: The breadth of this impact is evident in its influence on both healthcare providers and local authorities, while the depth is reflected in its potential to transform carer assessment methods at a foundational level.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: Recommendations for carer assessments and support can be scaled to different geographic regions and adapted to various social care systems (page 74).
Section: Recommendations for Research.
Example: The guideline can be scaled from local authorities to national healthcare systems, and transferred across different regions and countries with similar social care structures.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study proposes innovative approaches such as peer support models and flexible carer assessments, which disrupt traditional methods by placing a greater emphasis on the carer’s emotional and psychological needs (page 75).
Section: Recommendations.
Example: The innovative aspect of introducing flexible carer assessments could disrupt current bureaucratic methods, fostering more individualized and adaptive support for carers.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The guideline promotes ethical caregiving by emphasizing carer rights and the need for equitable support systems, aligned with the Care Act 2014 (page 72-73).
Section: Overview and Recommendations.
Example: This research ensures sustainability by encouraging systems that adapt to carers' changing needs, and the focus on ethical caregiving ensures that carers receive fair treatment and recognition for their unpaid work.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research provides practical tools and recommendations for immediate implementation by local authorities and healthcare providers, ensuring usability across different contexts (page 74).
Section: Recommendations for Research.
Example: The usability is ensured through practical recommendations for carer support that can be implemented at the local authority level, making the research accessible and actionable.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: Though the study is UK-based, the recommendations for carer support have cross-disciplinary relevance, influencing health policy, social care, and psychological support systems globally (page 75).
Section: Rationale and Impact.
Example: The global relevance is evident in the adaptable nature of the recommendations, which can be transferred to other countries with similar care systems, and the cross-disciplinary impact influences healthcare, social work, and community services.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The guideline emphasizes adaptability in carer support, recommending flexible solutions that respond to carers' changing roles and circumstances (page 75-76).
Section: Recommendations.
Example: Resilience is highlighted through recommendations that support carers during life transitions, ensuring that the system remains flexible and responsive to their needs over time.
