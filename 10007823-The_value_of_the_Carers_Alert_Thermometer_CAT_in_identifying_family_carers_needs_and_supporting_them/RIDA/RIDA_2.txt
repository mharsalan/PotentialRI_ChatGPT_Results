
The research study titled Supporting family carers providing end-of-life home care: a qualitative study on the impact of a hospice at home service explores the experiences of bereaved family carers regarding a hospice at home service. Based on the paper and aligning it with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, here's an assessment of its potential research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research falls under multiple domains, including:

Health Domain: The study addresses critical health care issues surrounding palliative care at home.
Social Domain: It highlights the impact of hospice care on family dynamics and support structures in society.
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 134-136​(2). Example: The research influences health care systems by providing evidence for the importance of individualized palliative care support, which improves patient outcomes and family well-being during end-of-life care.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study has both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it helps optimize hospice care practices and improves family carers' coping mechanisms. In the long term, it contributes to the foundational knowledge of hospice services and their role in healthcare policy.

Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 136​(2). Example: Short-term impacts involve immediate adjustments in how hospice services are delivered, while the long-term impact includes informing policies that may improve future end-of-life care at home.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The direct stakeholders are family carers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers involved in palliative care services. Indirectly, society benefits through improved end-of-life care models.

Page Reference and Section: Methods, page 132; Results, page 135​(2)​(2). Example: Healthcare providers use the study to improve hospice service design, while policymakers can base future care models on its findings to address the increasing demand for home-based end-of-life services.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research has a deep impact within palliative care by addressing the specific needs of family carers. It also has broad implications for healthcare policy, influencing future caregiving practices and public health frameworks.

Page Reference and Section: Results, page 135​(2). Example: Deep impact is seen in how it reshapes the understanding of hospice care at home, while broad impact arises from its potential to influence healthcare policies across regions and internationally.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The hospice model discussed in the study is scalable, as it can be adapted to different regions and healthcare systems, both in resource-rich and resource-poor countries. The model’s flexibility makes it transferable across various healthcare settings.

Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 131​(2). Example: The service can be scaled to other countries facing similar palliative care challenges and transferred to different cultural settings with adjustments to local care practices.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces an innovative approach to palliative care by focusing on individualized and home-based care that can prevent unnecessary hospital admissions. It disrupts traditional hospital-based care models for terminally ill patients.

Page Reference and Section: Results, page 136​(2). Example: The innovation lies in the tailored, flexible service that supports carers' needs, potentially disrupting current care models by making home care a more viable option for many families.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research addresses sustainability in terms of caregiving, emphasizing the importance of supporting family carers to prevent burnout and ensure continuity of care. Ethically, it promotes patient and family autonomy in care decisions.

Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 137​(2). Example: The sustainability of the hospice service model ensures that family carers are supported, enabling long-term care without overwhelming resources, and ethically promotes respecting patients' wishes to remain at home.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings are highly implementable in real-world hospice services. The study suggests regular assessments of family carers' needs and flexible service designs, making the recommendations practical and usable for care providers.

Page Reference and Section: Conclusions, page 137​(2). Example: Hospice organizations can implement the service model by training staff in providing tailored support to meet the unique needs of different families.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While the study focuses on a hospice service in the UK, it has global relevance, as the challenges of providing end-of-life care at home are universal. The interdisciplinary nature of the research, spanning healthcare, social care, and psychology, adds to its broad applicability.

Page Reference and Section: Background, page 132​(2). Example: Other countries can adopt or adapt the model to improve their hospice services, especially in regions with developing healthcare infrastructures.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The service model is resilient and adaptable, designed to meet varying needs of patients and carers. It can be modified depending on the family structure, cultural expectations, and available healthcare resources.

Page Reference and Section: Results, page 135-136​(2). Example: The adaptability of the service is seen in how it supports carers who have other responsibilities, such as employment or caregiving for additional family members, making it flexible for diverse circumstances.

This impact assessment demonstrates that the study has a multifaceted influence on health care, policy, and family support systems, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding and enhancement of hospice services globally.
