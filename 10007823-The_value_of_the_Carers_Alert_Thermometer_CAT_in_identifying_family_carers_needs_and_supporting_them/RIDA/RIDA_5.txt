
Based on the provided documents, I have assessed the research impact dimensions of the study “Development of the Carers’ Alert Thermometer (CAT)” as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The CAT is an evidence-based alert thermometer consisting of 10 questions... aimed at supporting patient choice to remain in their own home" (Results, page 19).
Section: Results, Page 19.
Example: This research impacts multiple domains, including the health domain by enhancing patient care at home and reducing hospital admissions. It also has a social domain impact by improving family caregivers' ability to manage stress, avoiding caregiver crises, and preventing hospitalizations.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The CAT enables the identification of current and potential future needs so a proactive approach can be taken to supporting the carer" (Conclusions, page 19).
Section: Conclusions, Page 19.
Example: The short-term impact includes immediate improvement in caregiving through early identification of needs. The long-term impact lies in reducing the burden on healthcare systems by preventing unnecessary hospitalizations and ensuring sustainable home care solutions.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The CAT was developed using a multi-phased approach capturing the views of current carers, past carers, professionals from health and social care, and policy advisors" (Discussion, page 17).
Section: Discussion, Page 17.
Example: Direct stakeholders include family caregivers and healthcare providers. Indirect stakeholders include healthcare systems and policymakers, benefiting from reduced hospital admissions and improved home care outcomes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "Preliminary piloting of the CAT has shown it to be valued, fit for purpose and it can be administered by a range of personnel" (Results, page 19).
Section: Results, Page 19.
Example: The study’s deep impact is evident in its specific influence on palliative care practices, while its broad impact crosses into social care, health policy, and caregiver well-being, providing a tool adaptable across different care settings.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "The planned study will enable the CAT to be administered over a longer period of time with carers from various settings" (Discussion, page 17).
Section: Discussion, Page 17.
Example: The CAT is scalable from pilot studies to broader use across different healthcare settings, and transferable across geographical locations, making it applicable for both registered and unregistered healthcare professionals.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "The CAT’s design is unique amongst carer assessment tools... facilitating a focused appraisal of how a carer is coping" (Results, page 19).
Section: Results, Page 19.
Example: The CAT introduces an innovative approach to caregiver support by combining subjective and objective assessments. It has the potential to disrupt traditional, reactive caregiving models by encouraging proactive and preventive care for family caregivers.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The CAT enables identification of future needs... preventing avoidable hospital admissions and supporting patient choice to remain in their own home" (Conclusions, page 19).
Section: Conclusions, Page 19.
Example: The study promotes sustainability by helping caregivers manage home care, reducing the need for institutional care. Ethically, it aligns with patient autonomy and family well-being by preventing crises that can lead to unnecessary hospitalization.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "Preliminary piloting of the CAT has shown it to be... administered by a range of personnel" (Results, page 19).
Section: Results, Page 19.
Example: The CAT has been designed for ease of use across a broad spectrum of caregivers and healthcare professionals, ensuring practical application in real-world settings, particularly for non-specialists.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "The increasing international policy direction to promote home death... will undoubtedly have an impact on the demands placed upon family carers" (Discussion, page 17).
Section: Discussion, Page 17.
Example: The research has global relevance, impacting healthcare policies worldwide as many countries focus on home-based care for terminally ill patients, especially in palliative care contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The CAT offers a short proactive alert tool to identify carers with unmet needs" (Discussion, page 17).
Section: Discussion, Page 17.
Example: The CAT’s flexibility allows it to adapt to evolving caregiver situations, helping caregivers become more resilient by providing early alerts that trigger appropriate support.
These dimensions capture the broad and far-reaching impacts of the Carers’ Alert Thermometer study, especially in enhancing home care and reducing hospital dependency for terminal patients.
