
To assess the research impact of the study "The Carers' Alert Thermometer (CAT): supporting family carers of people living with motor neurone disease," I will evaluate it against the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions as outlined in the instructions. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"The CAT provides a structure enabling AVs to engage in a meaningful process with family carers to identify and discuss their needs" (Discussion, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Clinical, page 116.
Example: The study impacts the health domain by offering a structured tool (CAT) that improves the identification and support of caregivers' needs, enhancing the caregiving experience for individuals with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The CAT has potential to map change over time, help to focus on carers’ needs and improve communication with carers" (Findings, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Findings, page 116.
Example: The long-term impact of this research lies in its ability to continuously track and address caregivers’ needs over time, thereby fostering sustainable improvements in caregiver support practices.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Family carers rarely discuss their own needs or consider seeking help for themselves, deferring instead to the needs of the person for whom they care" (Background, page 115)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Background, page 115.
Example: The primary stakeholders impacted by the CAT tool are family carers of MND patients, as well as the healthcare providers (MND Association visitors), who benefit from better structured interactions with caregivers.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"It is known that multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement is beneficial for people living with MND and their level of satisfaction with care" (Background, page 114)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Background, page 114.
Example: The research has deep impact within the caregiving field by introducing a detailed, systematic approach to assessing caregiver needs. The breadth of impact extends to healthcare teams, enhancing how they engage with and support family caregivers across various disciplines.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"An alternative is for volunteers to work with carers to help identify and triage their needs using an alert tool such as the CAT" (Method, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Method, page 116.
Example: The CAT tool has strong scalability potential as it can be implemented by a wide range of non-specialist staff and volunteers. Its transferability is evident in its adaptability for use in different caregiving scenarios, not just for MND but for other progressive illnesses requiring caregiving.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"The CAT was designed as a speedy alert tool to be completed by non-specialist staff or volunteers, collaboratively with the carer" (Background, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Background, page 116.
Example: The innovation lies in the CAT’s approach, which simplifies the caregiving needs assessment process, allowing volunteers to contribute meaningfully. This disrupts traditional caregiving support models by involving non-healthcare professionals in a critical role.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Interventions to improve the carer experience in MND are lacking... There is a sparsity of evidence-based instruments suitable for use in everyday practice" (Discussion, page 115)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, page 115.
Example: The CAT tool enhances the sustainability of caregiving by identifying carers' needs early, preventing burnout and improving their quality of life. Ethically, it empowers carers to express their own needs, ensuring they receive appropriate support.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Workshops were held by the research team in 2015 and 2016 for AVs and staff in northwest and southwest England" (Method, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Method, page 116.
Example: The usability of the CAT tool is demonstrated by its implementation through workshops and its subsequent use by AVs with family carers. The simplicity of the tool ensures widespread adoption by non-specialist staff.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"It is known that multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement is beneficial for people living with MND" (Background, page 114)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Background, page 114.
Example: The CAT tool is relevant across disciplines, including nursing, palliative care, and social support, ensuring cross-disciplinary impact. Its global relevance stems from the potential applicability in supporting caregivers worldwide, particularly in homecare settings.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The CAT provides a structure enabling AVs to engage in a meaningful process with family carers to identify and discuss their needs" (Discussion, page 116)​(6).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, page 116.
Example: The CAT tool’s resilience is highlighted by its ability to adapt to various caregiving contexts and provide long-term support. Its adaptability ensures that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of carers over time.

This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the research impact dimensions for the CAT study. Each dimension reflects how the tool contributes to improving caregiving for MND patients across various societal, health, and policy domains.
