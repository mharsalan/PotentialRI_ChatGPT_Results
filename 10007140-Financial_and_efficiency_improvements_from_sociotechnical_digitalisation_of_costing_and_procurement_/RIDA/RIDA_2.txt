Based on the research paper you uploaded and the top dimensions of research impact, I will assess how each of these dimensions applies to the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The study's focus on Building Information Modeling (BIM) adoption within the UK construction supply chain highlights a significant impact on the technological domain by advocating for enhanced design coordination, risk reduction, and better data communication (Results, page 5).
Example: The research impacts the technological domain by advancing BIM practices, influencing how construction projects are designed and managed through innovative data sharing systems, ultimately affecting the industry’s productivity and collaboration​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The adoption of BIM offers both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it improves project efficiency and collaboration (Discussion, page 15), while in the long term, it has the potential to reshape supply chain dynamics and reduce costs (Conclusion, page 17).
Example: In the short term, BIM can immediately improve project coordination and cost savings in construction projects, while long-term impacts include its potential to influence broader industry standards, paving the way for the future integration of AI and other technologies in construction​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The study identifies key stakeholders such as main contractors and tier 2 subcontractors within the construction supply chain. These stakeholders are crucial for the successful implementation of BIM, as their adoption of the technology is pivotal for project success (Methodology, page 12).
Example: The research impacts main contractors by providing data on subcontractor attitudes toward BIM adoption, enabling these contractors to tailor their strategies for integrating new technologies into their workflows​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research has a deep impact on the construction industry by addressing the specific operational challenges subcontractors face when adopting BIM (Results, page 12). Additionally, its broad impact extends to informing policy and industry standards for BIM use (Discussion, page 16).
Example: The deep impact is seen in how it transforms subcontractor practices, while the broad impact influences national policies and strategies aimed at increasing BIM adoption in the construction sector​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: BIM’s adoption has significant scalability potential, as demonstrated by its ability to be applied across various project sizes and complexities, from small-scale projects to large infrastructure developments (Results, page 16).
Example: The research indicates that BIM can be scaled to national levels within the construction sector, leading to industry-wide productivity improvements. Furthermore, the BIM framework is transferable across different sectors within construction, including residential and commercial projects​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: BIM is identified as an innovative solution with the potential to disrupt traditional construction workflows by improving collaboration, communication, and efficiency through digital technologies (Discussion, page 16).
Example: BIM’s disruption potential lies in its ability to fundamentally change the construction industry’s reliance on fragmented supply chains, replacing traditional communication methods with integrated digital workflows​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The research acknowledges BIM's role in promoting sustainable construction practices by reducing material waste and enhancing project coordination (Results, page 15).
Example: By improving design accuracy and reducing on-site errors, BIM contributes to sustainability in construction, aligning with ethical goals of reducing environmental impact through more efficient use of resources​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the usability of BIM across various project stages, including design, execution, and management, highlighting its ease of implementation once subcontractors are properly trained (Results, page 15).
Example: The implementation of BIM is practical for companies with varying degrees of digital maturity, making it accessible to both large contractors and small subcontractors, thus enhancing its usability across the industry​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The application of BIM extends beyond construction to influence other disciplines such as architecture, engineering, and urban planning, highlighting its cross-disciplinary relevance (Introduction, page 3).
Example: BIM’s global relevance is seen in its adoption by governments worldwide to standardize construction practices, making it a tool for international collaboration in infrastructure projects​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The study indicates that BIM enhances the resilience of construction companies by enabling them to adapt quickly to project changes and market demands through better information sharing and collaboration (Discussion, page 16).
Example: The adaptability of BIM allows construction companies to remain competitive by integrating new technologies that improve project flexibility and responsiveness to client needs​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Each dimension demonstrates how the study on BIM adoption in the UK construction industry can influence various sectors and contribute to sustainable, innovative, and cross-disciplinary practices.
