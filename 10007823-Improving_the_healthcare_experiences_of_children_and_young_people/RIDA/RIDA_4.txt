
Based on the provided research study, "Depression, anxiety, and loneliness among adolescents and young adults with IBD in the UK," I will now map the findings to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study directly impacts the health domain by exploring the mental health issues (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) experienced by adolescents and young adults (AYA) with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). It also affects the social domain by analyzing how embarrassment and social efficacy impact well-being.
Page Reference: Abstract, page 497.
Example: The findings could influence healthcare practices by encouraging the integration of mental health discussions into IBD clinical treatments, impacting patient care and mental health services for those with chronic illnesses.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research findings, particularly regarding the need to integrate mental health evaluations into routine clinical discussions, may have both short-term and long-term impacts.
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 505.
Example: In the short term, healthcare providers may adopt immediate changes in consultations with AYA with IBD. Long-term, the study could form a foundation for future research into chronic disease-related mental health, potentially influencing IBD treatment guidelines.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include healthcare providers who can use the study to improve patient care. Indirectly, patients with IBD and their families will benefit from improved mental health interventions.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 504.
Example: Healthcare professionals may adjust patient consultations to include mental health screenings, while IBD patients and their social circles could experience improved mental well-being and support.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has deep impact within the field of pediatric gastroenterology and broad impact across mental health, social sciences, and adolescent health research.
Page Reference: Results, page 501.
Example: Deep impact in advancing how IBD's psychosocial effects are understood in gastroenterology; broad impact in contributing to social science research on stigma, embarrassment, and adolescent mental health.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings are highly scalable for integration into healthcare settings worldwide, and transferable across different chronic disease populations.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 505.
Example: Screening protocols for mental health in IBD clinics can be scaled to other healthcare institutions and adapted to patients with chronic conditions beyond IBD, such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative approaches by linking embarrassment about IBD to mental health outcomes, potentially disrupting traditional approaches to treating IBD patients solely through physical health metrics.
Page Reference: Results, page 503.
Example: This could lead to disruptive changes in how clinicians approach chronic illness, emphasizing a holistic treatment model that integrates mental health assessments.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations are addressed by focusing on the psychosocial well-being of vulnerable youth populations, advocating for sustainable mental health support in healthcare settings.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 504.
Example: Introducing sustained psychological screening for chronic disease patients ensures long-term health equity, addressing both physical and mental health sustainably.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study's findings are highly implementable in clinical settings, encouraging the adoption of routine mental health screenings for AYA with IBD.
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 505.
Example: Usability is reflected in its practical recommendations for healthcare providers to integrate discussions of mental health and embarrassment into regular IBD consultations.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research has relevance across multiple disciplines, including healthcare, social psychology, and adolescent medicine, with potential applicability in global healthcare systems.
Page Reference: Introduction, page 498.
Example: The studyâ€™s findings could inform mental health policies globally, as chronic illness impacts mental health across different cultural and geographic settings.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study demonstrates adaptability by focusing on different psychosocial challenges faced by AYA, including the flexibility of incorporating findings across varying levels of disease severity and social situations.
Page Reference: Results, page 503.
Example: Healthcare systems can adapt these findings to support various patient demographics, ensuring resilience in healthcare delivery for IBD and chronic illness management across patient populations.
This detailed analysis follows the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact for the attached study, mapping the findings and their potential contributions across multiple dimensions.
