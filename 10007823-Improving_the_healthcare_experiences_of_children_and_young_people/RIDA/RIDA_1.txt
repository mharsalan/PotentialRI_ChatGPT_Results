
Based on the content extracted from both the uploaded documents​(1)​(Knowledge - Potential R…), I will provide a detailed analysis of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions for the study titled "Holding Children for Clinical Procedures: Perseverance in Spite of or Persevering to be Child-Centered."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The study focuses on the experiences and dynamics of clinical holding for children during medical procedures, with implications for healthcare practice and policy regarding the treatment of children. It investigates the balance between enforcing necessary medical interventions and maintaining a child-centered approach to care.
"Professionals need to be clear about their boundaries when starting or continuing with a procedure when a child is distressed" (Results section).
Page Reference: Results, page 32-33​(1).
Example: This research impacts the Health Domain by influencing clinical practices regarding pediatric care. It provides insights into improving communication and preparation strategies with children to minimize distress during procedures, thus potentially shaping hospital policies and training for healthcare providers.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The findings highlight the need for long-term improvements in clinical training and policy to better support child-centered care during medical procedures.
"Perseverance to be child-centered...was characterized by a purposeful plan of action focused on a child who had been prepared and informed..." (Discussion section).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 35​(1).
Example: The study is likely to have long-term impacts by informing future healthcare protocols, particularly in pediatric care. Over time, it could contribute to the development of new policies for handling children during distressing medical interventions.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:
Key stakeholders include healthcare professionals, parents, and children undergoing medical procedures.
"Parents and health professionals followed a trajectory... to complete a procedure in spite of the child being uncooperative" (Results section).
Page Reference: Results, page 32​(1).
Example: The primary direct stakeholders are healthcare providers and medical institutions, as the research offers practical guidelines for managing pediatric patients during medical procedures. Indirect stakeholders include parents and the broader public who benefit from improved healthcare practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
The research provides a deep understanding of the emotional and physical dynamics involved in clinical holding of children, a niche but critical aspect of pediatric care.
"Perseverance in spite of... when the procedure was completed despite a child’s upset and lack of cooperation..." (Discussion section).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 33​(1).
Example: This study has a deep impact within the field of pediatric healthcare, influencing how medical professionals approach child-centered care during distressing procedures. Its findings could eventually extend to broader healthcare policies and practices across various medical institutions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
The study suggests that its findings can be applied across different hospitals and healthcare settings, especially in training programs and pediatric units.
"Preparation and engagement activities with children and parents before, during, and after clinical procedures" (Results section).
Page Reference: Results, page 34​(1).
Example: The research has scalability potential within pediatric healthcare globally, where the findings can inform standardized protocols for managing children during clinical procedures. It also has transferability to broader healthcare settings where patient-centered approaches are required.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
The study introduces an innovative framework for understanding "perseverance to be child-centered" as a strategy for improving pediatric care.
"Professionals need to support preparation and engagement activities with children..." (Discussion section).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 34​(1).
Example: This research has the potential to disrupt traditional methods of handling children during medical procedures by introducing a more compassionate, child-centered approach that prioritizes the psychological and emotional well-being of the patient over merely completing the procedure.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
Ethical considerations are central to the study's focus on minimizing distress and trauma in children during medical procedures.
"Being held or restrained for clinical procedures can be a highly traumatic experience for children, their parents, and the health professionals working with them" (Introduction section).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 31​(1).
Example: The research promotes ethical healthcare practices by highlighting the need for restraint in a way that minimizes harm and promotes long-term psychological well-being. It supports sustainable improvements in healthcare through better training and policies that emphasize ethical child-centered care.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
Practical applications of the study include training modules for healthcare professionals on managing pediatric distress during procedures.
"The findings highlight that professionals need to be clear about their boundaries..." (Results section).
Page Reference: Results, page 33​(1).
Example: The research has high usability for pediatric healthcare providers, offering actionable insights into improving patient care by adopting child-centered practices. This can be directly implemented into clinical protocols and training programs.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
Although focused on pediatric healthcare, the principles of child-centered care and managing distress have relevance across multiple healthcare disciplines.
"The need to consider the child’s emotional and psychological state..." (Discussion section).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 35​(1).
Example: The research holds cross-disciplinary relevance for fields such as psychology, social work, and education, where managing distress in children is critical. Globally, the findings can inform healthcare practices in diverse cultural contexts, especially in hospitals and clinics handling pediatric patients.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
The study highlights the need for healthcare providers to adapt their approach based on the emotional and physical state of the child.
"There was a ‘window of opportunity’ at the start of the procedure when the child was calm and engaged" (Discussion section).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 35​(1).
Example: The research fosters resilience by equipping healthcare professionals with adaptable strategies to handle pediatric patients, ensuring that even in high-stress environments, care remains child-centered and effective.
This detailed analysis reflects the study's potential across multiple dimensions of research impact, offering both deep and broad contributions to pediatric healthcare.
