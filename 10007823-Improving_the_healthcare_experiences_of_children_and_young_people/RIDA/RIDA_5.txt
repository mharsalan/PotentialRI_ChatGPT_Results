
Based on the provided document and dimensions of Research Impact, here is an assessment of the research study titled "I Don’t Like to Make a Big Thing out of It": A Qualitative Interview‐Based Study Exploring Factors Affecting Whether Young People Tell or Do Not Tell Their Friends about Their IBD in the context of the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: This study primarily impacts the health domain by exploring how young people manage chronic conditions (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, IBD) in social contexts. It also affects the social domain by addressing issues of identity management, stigma, and peer relationships among young people with hidden health conditions (e.g., "Disclosure of a chronic condition is not a single event, and it is dependent on many factors..." - Introduction, Page 1).

Page Reference: Introduction, Page 1.
Example: The study provides insights that can help health professionals and caregivers improve communication strategies with young patients about the psychosocial aspects of chronic illness, thereby contributing to better health outcomes and social integration.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The research provides immediate insights into young people's management of IBD, which can be used to improve clinical practices, but also sets the groundwork for future studies on chronic illness disclosure in other age groups and conditions. ("The findings are foundational for understanding the psychological aspects of IBD disclosure" - Results, Page 6).

Page Reference: Results, Page 6.
Example: The short-term impact involves immediate applications in clinical settings, such as improving patient-doctor communication around disclosure. Long-term, this research could inform future studies on hidden chronic conditions and their psychosocial implications, influencing policies around healthcare and education for individuals with chronic illnesses.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders include healthcare providers, educators, and young people with IBD. The study's findings will benefit health professionals in supporting young patients and may also influence policymakers in health and education. ("Provision of support... is something that could be woven into an ongoing dialogue between young people and health professionals" - Discussion, Page 8).

Page Reference: Discussion, Page 8.
Example: Healthcare providers can use these insights to guide young patients in managing their social relationships while handling chronic conditions. Policymakers in health and education sectors might implement these findings into youth health programs.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research has deep impact within the field of chronic illness management in young people by addressing the emotional and social challenges related to disclosure. It also has broad impact across healthcare and social work by exploring the interplay between health and social connectedness. ("Decisions about disclosure... reveal complex dynamics in young people’s social lives" - Results, Page 4).

Page Reference: Results, Page 4.
Example: This study’s deep impact can change clinical practices in adolescent care. Its broad impact extends to educators and counselors who can integrate these insights into social support programs for students with chronic conditions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings on disclosure and identity management can be scaled up to apply to broader populations with chronic illnesses, and transferred to contexts beyond IBD, such as other hidden or stigmatized conditions. ("These insights could apply to other health conditions where disclosure is a critical issue" - Results, Page 7).

Page Reference: Results, Page 7.
Example: The research can be transferred to studies on conditions like diabetes or mental health disorders, where managing social identity and disclosure is also challenging.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative approaches, such as using friendship maps and photographs, to understand young people's social relationships and health management, though it is not highly disruptive. ("We used friendship maps and photographs... offering a novel method to explore social connectedness" - Methods, Page 5).

Page Reference: Methods, Page 5.
Example: These innovative methodologies could inspire new research techniques in qualitative studies focusing on youth health.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research ethically involves young people in a participatory framework, ensuring that their voices guide the research process, thereby promoting sustainable patient-centered care practices. ("We engaged young people throughout... ensuring their involvement in shaping the study" - Methods, Page 5).

Page Reference: Methods, Page 5.
Example: The ethical involvement of participants strengthens the sustainability of findings, as future studies may adopt these practices to ensure patient-centered care is a lasting principle.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings are highly usable in clinical settings, providing actionable strategies for health professionals to support young people with chronic illnesses in managing disclosure. ("Professionals could provide support for disclosure discussions in clinical settings" - Discussion, Page 8).

Page Reference: Discussion, Page 8.
Example: The practical implementation of the findings could improve how healthcare providers counsel young patients about disclosing their condition, fostering better health outcomes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study is cross-disciplinary, combining insights from psychology, health, and education. It also has the potential for global relevance, as the issue of chronic illness disclosure among young people is a universal challenge. ("These findings are relevant to global health contexts where chronic illness is prevalent" - Discussion, Page 9).

Page Reference: Discussion, Page 9.
Example: Insights from this study could be applied globally, particularly in low-resource settings where chronic illness disclosure might be fraught with stigma.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study highlights young people's resilience in managing IBD and adapting their social identities in the face of chronic illness. It underscores the need for adaptable support systems to assist them in disclosure processes. ("Young people demonstrate resilience in managing social dynamics related to their illness" - Results, Page 6).

Page Reference: Results, Page 6.
Example: This research informs adaptive healthcare practices that can better support young people’s resilience in managing their chronic conditions in varied social contexts.
This structured assessment of the research study based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact provides a comprehensive view of its broad implications across different sectors.
