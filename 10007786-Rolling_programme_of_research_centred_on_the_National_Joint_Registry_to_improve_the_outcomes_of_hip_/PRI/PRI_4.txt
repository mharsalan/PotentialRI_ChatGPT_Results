Based on the study "How long does a knee replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up", here are the potential research impacts organized according to different dimensions and types of impacts. These align with the research impact framework from various sources, including academic, societal, economic, and healthcare impacts.

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: The study contributes to orthopedic surgery and biomechanics by providing long-term survival data on knee replacements. It refines our understanding of implant longevity and highlights areas where future research is needed to improve the outcomes of knee replacement surgeries.
Example: The research shows that 82% of total knee replacements (TKRs) and 70% of unicompartmental knee replacements (UKRs) last 25 years, providing foundational data for further studies on material science and implant designs​(4)​(Common Research Impact …).
Influence on Future Research: It sets a benchmark for future orthopedic studies and could inspire comparative research on other types of joint replacements or implant technologies.
Example: This research could lead to further studies examining other variables that affect implant longevity, such as patient demographics or activity levels.
2. Health and Well-being Impact
Improvement in Clinical Practice: The study informs evidence-based clinical decisions, enabling healthcare providers to offer more accurate counseling regarding the expected lifespan of knee replacements.
Example: Physicians can better predict when patients may need revision surgery and adjust long-term treatment plans accordingly​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Patient Outcomes: By clarifying the durability of knee implants, the study helps to manage patient expectations and improve quality of life by ensuring they are better informed about their treatment outcomes.
Example: Knowing that 82% of TKRs last 25 years allows patients to make informed decisions, which could enhance post-surgical satisfaction and mental well-being​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Societal Impact
Public Awareness: The research can help raise awareness of knee replacement surgery longevity, influencing both patient choices and public health discourse about joint replacements and aging populations.

Example: Media outlets or healthcare organizations could disseminate the findings to educate aging populations on the longevity of knee implants, potentially influencing decisions about undergoing surgery​(impact pathway).
Behavioral Change: It may influence healthcare-seeking behavior, as patients are reassured by the long lifespan of these implants, making them more likely to pursue surgery earlier, thereby improving mobility and quality of life sooner.

Example: By knowing the long-term benefits, patients may opt for knee replacement surgeries earlier, leading to better mobility and reduced pain over time​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Economic Impact
Healthcare Cost Management: By demonstrating the long-term viability of knee replacements, the study has implications for healthcare budgeting and resource allocation, potentially reducing costs related to revision surgeries.
Example: Fewer revision surgeries could lead to substantial cost savings for healthcare systems globally, especially in aging populations with a high incidence of osteoarthritis​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Policy Influence: Policymakers may use this data to adjust healthcare strategies and funding, ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated for knee replacement surgeries, especially considering the rising demands of aging populations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Technological Impact
Innovation in Implant Design: The study provides valuable feedback to medical device manufacturers, who may use the findings to innovate and design more durable and effective knee implants.
Example: Insights into the factors affecting implant longevity could lead to the development of new materials or designs that extend the lifespan of knee replacements beyond 25 years​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainability in Healthcare: By reducing the number of revision surgeries, the study indirectly contributes to the sustainability of healthcare practices, minimizing resource use and reducing the environmental footprint associated with repeated surgeries and medical waste​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Policy and Advocacy Impact
Influence on Health Policy: The results of the study could inform national healthcare policies, particularly in countries with public health systems, helping them plan for the increasing demand for joint replacements as populations age.

Example: Policymakers may adjust healthcare strategies to accommodate the high success rates of knee replacements, potentially improving access to these surgeries in underserved populations​(Research impact toolkit).
Advocacy for Accessibility: Organizations advocating for better healthcare access might use these findings to lobby for broader availability of knee replacement surgeries, especially in regions where such treatments are less accessible​(Research Impact Knowled…).

8. Global Relevance and Cross-disciplinary Impact
Global Healthcare Implications: Given that knee replacement is a common surgery worldwide, the findings have relevance across various health systems, especially in countries with aging populations where osteoarthritis is prevalent.

Example: The study’s results can be applied in different cultural and healthcare contexts, potentially influencing global healthcare guidelines for joint replacement surgeries​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Cross-disciplinary Influence: The study’s methodology and findings could influence related fields such as biomechanics, gerontology, and public health by providing data relevant to aging, mobility, and long-term healthcare planning​(Common Research Impact …).

9. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study can be scaled across different populations and regions to assess whether similar long-term results are achieved globally, influencing local and international healthcare planning.
Example: Similar studies could be conducted in other regions to compare knee implant longevity across different healthcare systems and demographic groups​(impact pathway).
Transferability to Other Joints: The approach and findings could be transferred to studies on other joint replacements, such as hip or shoulder replacements, aiding in understanding the long-term success of other types of implants​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Ethical and Legal Considerations
Informed Consent: The study provides data that supports more informed consent processes, ensuring that patients have a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of knee replacement surgeries.
Example: Surgeons can use the study’s findings to offer better guidance to patients, ensuring that they are aware of the potential long-term outcomes of their surgeries​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Clinical Practice Improvement
Enhancement of Surgical Guidelines: The data could lead to updated guidelines in orthopedic surgery, incorporating long-term survival data to improve patient outcomes.
Example: Surgeons may adjust their recommendations regarding the timing and type of implants used, ensuring that they opt for devices with proven long-term success​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
This list organizes the potential research impacts of the study across various domains, emphasizing its contributions to healthcare, policy, economic efficiency, and global health.
