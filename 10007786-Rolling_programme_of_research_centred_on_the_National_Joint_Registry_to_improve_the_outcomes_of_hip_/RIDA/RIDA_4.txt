I have reviewed the paper you uploaded, titled "How long does a knee replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up" (published in The Lancet), and will now assess it according to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as per your instructions.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research primarily impacts the health domain by assessing the longevity of knee replacements, a common treatment for osteoarthritis. It also has implications for public policy, healthcare economics, and clinical practice. The study estimates survival rates of knee replacement constructs (TKRs and UKRs), providing data useful for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers:

"Our pooled registry data...shows that approximately 82% of TKRs last 25 years and 70% of UKRs last 25 years." (Results, page 656)​(4).
Example: The research informs clinical guidelines on knee replacements, which can impact healthcare delivery by improving patient counseling and expectations for implant longevity.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study offers long-term data on knee replacements, showing their effectiveness over decades, contributing both immediate and future impact to clinical practices and healthcare planning.

"The pooled registry 25 year survival of TKRs was 82.3%...These findings will be of use to patients and healthcare providers." (Interpretation, page 655)​(4).
Example: The research provides foundational data that will guide long-term orthopedic practices and inform future revisions of clinical guidelines, shaping medical treatment strategies for decades.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The stakeholders impacted by this research include:

Patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.
Healthcare providers who use this data to inform treatment decisions.
Policymakers responsible for healthcare planning and resource allocation.
Medical device manufacturers.
Example: Healthcare providers can use this data to better inform patients about the expected longevity of their knee replacements, while policymakers can allocate resources based on the long-term efficacy of implants.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research has deep impact within orthopedic surgery and medical device development by providing critical long-term survival data for implants. It also has broad implications across healthcare systems globally by influencing healthcare policies and treatment protocols.

"Knowing what the long-term failure rates are is important to facilitate resource planning, medicolegal assessment, benchmarking of different implants..." (Introduction, page 655)​(4).
Example: The deep impact is seen in clinical orthopedic practice, while the broad impact extends to health economics and policy, as this data influences cost and resource planning for knee replacement surgeries.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study’s findings on the longevity of knee replacements can be scaled up to inform global healthcare systems, especially as knee replacement surgeries are among the most common globally. The research can also be transferred to other joint replacement studies or broader orthopedic practices.

"These findings will be of use to patients and healthcare providers; further information is required to predict exactly how long specific knee replacements will last." (Interpretation, page 655)​(4).
Example: The findings can be used by global healthcare providers to predict knee replacement longevity in various populations, making the research scalable across different healthcare systems.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: While the study does not introduce new technologies, it innovates by providing the first generalizable estimate of knee replacement survival at 25 years, which can influence future implant design and healthcare policies.

"To our knowledge, we have provided the first simple and generalisable estimate of the survival of knee replacements at 25 years..." (Added value of this study, page 657)​(4).
Example: The innovation lies in the longevity data, which could disrupt current perceptions of knee replacement durability and inform new implant designs focused on even longer-term success.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study indirectly touches on sustainability by highlighting the need for long-lasting implants, which could reduce the need for revision surgeries, thus minimizing healthcare costs and resource use. Ethical considerations involve ensuring informed consent by providing accurate data on implant longevity.

"Knowing when failure might happen is important...for the provision of informed consent to patients." (Introduction, page 655)​(4).
Example: Promoting longer-lasting implants supports the sustainability of healthcare resources by reducing the frequency of revision surgeries.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The results of the study are highly implementable in clinical settings, providing immediate value to healthcare professionals by giving clear data on knee replacement longevity, which can be directly used to manage patient expectations and treatment plans.

"These findings will be of use to patients and healthcare providers..." (Interpretation, page 655)​(4).
Example: Surgeons can use this data to advise patients on the expected lifespan of their knee implants and the likelihood of needing revision surgery.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study has global relevance as knee replacement is a common procedure worldwide, with the results being applicable across different healthcare systems. It also intersects with health economics and policy, given the costs associated with revision surgeries.

"In 2016, 108 713 knee replacement procedures were done in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man..." (Introduction, page 656)​(4).
Example: The study’s findings apply globally to all healthcare providers performing knee replacements, influencing policies in diverse health systems.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The research provides adaptable insights that can be integrated into different healthcare systems, taking into account varying implant designs and patient demographics. Its findings can be used to adjust clinical practices based on updated survival rates as new data becomes available.

"Further information is required to predict exactly how long specific knee replacements will last..." (Interpretation, page 655)​(4).
Example: As knee replacement technologies evolve, the adaptability of this research ensures that new data on implant durability can be incorporated into ongoing orthopedic practices.

This detailed assessment of the research paper maps its contributions across the top 10 research impact dimensions, providing a comprehensive understanding of its influence in both clinical and societal contexts.
