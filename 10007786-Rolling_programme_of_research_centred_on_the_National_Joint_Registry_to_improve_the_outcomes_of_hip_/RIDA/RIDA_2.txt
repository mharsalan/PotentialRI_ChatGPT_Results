To provide a detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Choice of Prosthetic Implant Combinations in Total Hip Replacement: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using UK and Swedish Hip Joint Registries Data", I will map the content to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" as outlined in the attached framework. Here's a breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study contributes primarily to the healthcare domain by evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various hip implant combinations for different age and gender groups. It combines clinical and economic data from the UK and Swedish joint registries, impacting health economics and healthcare policy.
"We compared the lifetime cost-effectiveness of implants for patients of different age and sex profiles." (Introduction, pg. 303)
Page Reference: Introduction, page 303.
Example: The research impacts healthcare systems by providing evidence-based guidelines for selecting cost-effective prosthetic implants. This can influence both clinical practice and procurement strategies, leading to better patient outcomes and healthcare spending efficiency.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study's impact is both short-term and long-term. It offers immediate guidance for healthcare payers and clinicians by identifying cost-effective prosthetic implants. Long-term, it may shape future prosthetic implant designs and healthcare policy decisions.
"Our findings can influence clinical practice and procurement decisions for healthcare payers worldwide." (Conclusions, pg. 312)
Page Reference: Conclusions, page 312.
Example: In the short term, the study can directly impact procurement decisions and patient care pathways in hip replacement surgeries. Long-term, it provides a foundational economic analysis that could be referenced in future studies or revisions in healthcare policies regarding surgical implants.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary stakeholders are healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, and policymakers involved in healthcare procurement. Secondary stakeholders include patients who benefit from more cost-effective and durable implant combinations.
"Our findings provide evidence to inform the decisions of patients, surgeons, and healthcare commissioners worldwide." (Introduction, pg. 303)
Page Reference: Introduction, page 303.
Example: Surgeons and hospital administrators are direct stakeholders as they can use this evidence to choose more cost-effective implants, which in turn affects the quality of patient care and the allocation of healthcare budgets.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has a deep impact within the field of orthopedic surgery, particularly in total hip replacement, by comparing different prosthetic implant combinations and their cost-effectiveness. Its breadth is also notable as it incorporates economic, clinical, and demographic data from two countries, extending its influence across healthcare and economics.
"We found no evidence that uncemented, hybrid, or reverse hybrid implants were the most cost-effective option for any patient group." (Results, pg. 305)
Page Reference: Results, page 305.
Example: The studyâ€™s deep impact lies in its contribution to orthopedic surgical practice by refining implant selection criteria. Its broad impact extends to healthcare economics and policy, as it provides evidence for cost-effective healthcare spending on a global scale.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The findings are scalable as they provide a framework that could be applied in various healthcare systems globally, beyond the UK and Sweden. Additionally, the model used can be transferred to analyze other types of surgeries or medical devices.
"Our work exceeds previous analyses by assessing complete implant combinations that form the constructs currently in clinical use." (Methods, pg. 304)
Page Reference: Methods, page 304.
Example: The cost-effectiveness model developed could be scaled up to inform national healthcare policies on medical device procurement or transferred to other surgical procedures where implant choices affect cost and patient outcomes.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces an innovative use of large-scale registry data and a comprehensive cost-effectiveness model that disrupts traditional approaches by integrating long-term economic and clinical data across diverse patient demographics.
"We used individual-patient observational data from the NJR, the largest national joint replacement cohort." (Methods, pg. 305)
Page Reference: Methods, page 305.
Example: The integration of real-world data from multiple countries represents a disruptive approach to evaluating prosthetic implants, which may set a new standard for how medical device cost-effectiveness is assessed.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study addresses the sustainability of healthcare by recommending cost-effective solutions that ensure long-term savings for healthcare systems. Ethically, it supports the fair allocation of medical resources by optimizing implant choices based on age and gender.
"We included the cost of the implant used in primary THR, but excluded the cost of primary THR surgery because we assumed these costs were common across implants." (Methods, pg. 306)
Page Reference: Methods, page 306.
Example: By promoting cost-effective implants, the study contributes to sustainable healthcare spending, ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most effective while maintaining high standards of patient care.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings can be implemented in clinical guidelines and procurement strategies, particularly in healthcare systems where cost-effectiveness is a priority. The model developed is user-friendly and adaptable for different healthcare settings.
"Small-head cemented metal-on-polyethylene implants were the most cost-effective for men and women older than 65 years." (Results, pg. 305)
Page Reference: Results, page 305.
Example: The study provides clear recommendations that can be integrated into clinical practice guidelines, making it easy for healthcare providers to implement cost-effective decisions in hip replacement surgeries.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study has relevance beyond orthopedics, impacting healthcare economics, public health policy, and even the development of new medical devices. Its global relevance is evident as it uses data from the UK and Sweden but offers insights applicable to healthcare systems worldwide.
"Our findings can influence clinical practice and procurement decisions for healthcare payers worldwide." (Conclusions, pg. 312)
Page Reference: Conclusions, page 312.
Example: The cross-disciplinary relevance of the research is seen in its use of economic, clinical, and demographic data, making it valuable for both healthcare professionals and policymakers globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The model used in the study is adaptable to changes in prosthetic technologies or healthcare costs, ensuring its resilience in the face of new developments in orthopedic surgery and healthcare policy.
"The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses." (Results, pg. 305)
Page Reference: Results, page 305.
Example: The adaptability of the study's model means it can continue to provide relevant guidance even as new implant technologies emerge or healthcare costs fluctuate, ensuring its long-term applicability.
This detailed assessment highlights how the research aligns with the top 10 research impact dimensions and provides concrete examples for each.
