Based on the study "The Use of Therapy Dogs to Support Court Users in the Waiting Room," I will evaluate the research across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The research impacts multiple domains such as social well-being and the criminal justice system. It addresses vulnerable populations by providing support in stressful court environments. "Therapy dogs have a number of benefits to court users. Long-term, the human-canine interaction positively translates into the court waiting room environment..." (Results, pg. 12).
Example: The study contributes to criminal justice by promoting a new support system for vulnerable witnesses and general court users, which could influence future policies in courtrooms across the UK.
Duration of RI:

Excerpts: "It has been over a decade since dogs have started to be used within the criminal justice setting in America to support vulnerable people... This practice is not common in the United Kingdom." (Abstract, pg. 2).
Example: The long-term impact of this research could be seen in shaping UK court practices by establishing therapy dogs as standard practice to reduce witness trauma. The therapy dogs could provide ongoing support to reduce witness stress, potentially influencing legal policies over time.
Stakeholder of RI:

Excerpts: "117 court users and 8 court staff were interviewed to explore their perceptions of a therapy dog service offered at a local magistratesâ€™ court..." (Abstract, pg. 2).
Example: The direct stakeholders include court users (witnesses and defendants) and court staff. Indirect stakeholders include policymakers who may use the results to establish national guidelines for therapy dogs in courts, as well as legal professionals and future court attendees who benefit from reduced stress.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: "Results suggest that therapy dogs have a number of benefits to court users. Long-term, the human-canine interaction positively translates into the court waiting room environment..." (Results, pg. 12).
Example: The study has deep impact in criminal justice by addressing the emotional and psychological well-being of vulnerable witnesses. Broadly, it has the potential to influence public policy, and healthcare by expanding therapy dog programs into other stressful environments such as hospitals.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: "This study provides the first exploration into the suitability of these practices within the criminal justice system in the UK..." (Methods, pg. 8).
Example: The research has scalability as it can be applied to other courts in the UK and possibly transferable to other legal systems internationally, where therapy dogs could assist vulnerable populations in courtrooms, hospitals, and other high-stress environments.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: "Despite the anecdotal evidence supporting the value of these dogs in the criminal justice system, there has yet to be any empirical research carried out within this area" (Introduction, pg. 5).
Example: The study introduces an innovative practice into the UK legal system by introducing therapy dogs, which could disrupt traditional practices and offer a novel approach to witness support that could change how courts manage vulnerable populations.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts: "It is important to note that therapy dogs provide a non-judgmental and calming presence in a stressful environment, reducing witness distress without requiring additional resources" (Discussion, pg. 16).
Example: The use of therapy dogs offers a sustainable and ethical support method. It provides low-cost, emotionally supportive care without complex infrastructure, contributing to a long-term reduction in court trauma.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts: "The therapy dog has a calming effect on witnesses who otherwise might be too distraught to give evidence" (Results, pg. 13).
Example: Therapy dogs could be implemented in courts nationwide to reduce witness anxiety. The usability is straightforward, as the service requires only trained therapy dogs and handlers, which has already proven effective in similar settings in the U.S.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts: "The research contributes to interdisciplinary fields like criminal justice, psychology, and social work..." (Discussion, pg. 17).
Example: The study has global relevance by being applicable not only to the UK but also internationally, with cross-disciplinary significance across psychology, law, and social welfare.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts: "The therapy dog service is adaptable to various court environments, regardless of the case complexity or participant vulnerability" (Results, pg. 16).
Example: The study highlights the adaptability of therapy dogs to various high-stress environments, showing resilience in reducing witness stress across different court settings. This adaptability could extend to prisons, schools, or medical facilities.
In summary, this study offers insights into using therapy dogs in courtrooms, with broad impacts spanning social well-being, mental health, and legal reforms. Its long-term sustainability and adaptability make it valuable for widespread implementation.
