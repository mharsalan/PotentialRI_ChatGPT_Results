Research Impact Pathways for the Study "Exploring the Impact of Specially Trained Dogs on the Court Experiences of Survivors of Sexual Offending"
To fully understand the research impact pathways for this study, we need to focus on how this research can transition from academic publication to meaningful societal, policy, and practical changes. Below is a detailed breakdown of these pathways before and after publication, aligned with the goals of achieving maximum impact across different research dimensions.

Before Publication: Laying the Groundwork for Impact
Conceptualization and Stakeholder Engagement

Collaboration with Legal and Social Services: Early in the research process, the study team would have engaged with court officials, social workers, and victim support services to ensure the relevance of the research. Identifying these stakeholders was crucial for shaping a study that directly addresses their needs and challenges​(2).
Engaging with Therapy Dog Providers: Collaborations with animal therapy organizations were necessary to define how therapy dogs would be trained and used in court settings. This early engagement provided the foundation for creating a sustainable, scalable, and ethically sound intervention​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Research Design and Ethical Framework

Multiple Case Study Approach: The research used a multiple case study design, collecting data through interviews, observations, and documentation. This allowed for a holistic understanding of how therapy dogs affect vulnerable court users, particularly survivors of sexual crimes​(2). This approach helps ensure that the findings can be applied in other contexts, such as other types of court cases or different vulnerable populations.
Addressing Ethical Considerations: Before the research began, ethics approval was crucial, especially given the sensitive nature of working with survivors of sexual offences. Ensuring informed consent and the protection of vulnerable participants built the foundation for ethical impact​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Pilot Testing and Feasibility Studies

Preliminary Trials: Early trials or pilot studies involving therapy dogs in controlled environments (such as pre-court interactions) provided essential feedback on the feasibility of using these interventions in real-life court settings. These early findings would help refine the methodology and ensure the intervention's practicality​(2).
Capacity Building

Training for Therapy Dog Handlers: Establishing rigorous training protocols for handlers and therapy dogs to ensure they can handle the unique stressors of a courtroom setting was a key pre-publication step. The researchers likely engaged in capacity-building efforts to ensure that therapy dogs could adapt to different court environments and user needs​(2).
After Publication: Pathways to Achieving Societal and Policy Impact
Once the research findings are published, the focus shifts to disseminating knowledge, influencing policy, and scaling the intervention to reach wider populations.

Dissemination of Research Findings

Academic Journals and Conferences: Publishing in journals like the European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research ensures the academic community is aware of the findings​(2). The research can be presented at interdisciplinary conferences that include fields such as criminal justice, psychology, and public health, amplifying its reach across multiple domains​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Open Access and Public Communication: Ensuring the study is available on open-access platforms allows practitioners, policymakers, and the general public to access and engage with the research findings. This also opens pathways for media outlets to cover the story, raising public awareness and potentially accelerating adoption​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Policy and Legislative Pathway

Engagement with Policymakers and Judicial Authorities: Post-publication, the research team can work with government bodies, the Ministry of Justice, and the judiciary to present their findings. By showcasing the positive outcomes of using therapy dogs in courts, they can push for changes in court policies that formalize therapy dog programs as part of the support for vulnerable witnesses​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Influencing National Legal Reforms: Based on the study’s findings, policymakers could introduce new legal provisions that make therapy dog interventions a standard measure for vulnerable court users. This research has the potential to become a model for reforming judicial practices, improving the experience of giving evidence for survivors of serious crimes like sexual assault​(2).
Scaling Up and Transferability

Expansion Across Court Systems: Therapy dog interventions can be scaled up from the initial study to be implemented across multiple courts in the UK. Based on the success in England and Wales, other regions or countries may adopt similar programs, ensuring transferability across different judicial and cultural contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Application to Other Vulnerable Populations: Beyond survivors of sexual offences, this approach could be transferred to support other vulnerable populations, such as children, elderly individuals, or those with mental health challenges, who might experience stress in other legal or high-stress environments​(2).
Developing Best Practices and Guidelines

Guideline Development for Court Systems: Based on the study’s conclusions, the research team can collaborate with legal bodies to develop best practice guidelines for integrating therapy dogs into court systems. This could include training protocols for dog handlers, criteria for selecting therapy dogs, and standards for when and how these services are applied during trials​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Training Workshops for Legal Professionals: Workshops and seminars for court staff, social workers, and lawyers on the benefits and implementation of therapy dogs will ensure that key stakeholders are equipped to use this intervention effectively​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Public and Community Engagement

Public Outreach and Awareness Campaigns: Engaging with the public through media stories, social media campaigns, and educational programs would raise awareness about the importance of supporting vulnerable court users. This type of public engagement could lead to widespread support for therapy dog programs, influencing both policy and public opinion​(2).
Collaboration with NGOs and Victim Support Organizations: By partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that focus on victim support, the research can be used to enhance existing services, advocating for therapy dogs as an essential part of the support infrastructure for victims​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Monitoring and Evaluation

Post-implementation Assessment: Once therapy dogs are integrated into court systems, continuous evaluation of their effectiveness will ensure the intervention remains relevant and impactful. Researchers can engage in long-term monitoring, collecting data on court outcomes, witness well-being, and public trust in the justice system​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Feedback Loops: Feedback from court users, legal professionals, and dog handlers will allow for iterative improvements to the therapy dog program, ensuring it adapts to new challenges or environments​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Conclusion
The pathways to research impact for this study encompass a robust mix of pre-publication groundwork (such as capacity building and stakeholder engagement) and post-publication dissemination, policy influence, and practical implementation. By engaging with legal authorities, NGOs, and the public, the study can transform its academic findings into tangible societal and policy changes, ensuring that therapy dogs become a regular part of the support framework for vulnerable court users. Through scalability and transferability, this impact can extend beyond the initial court system to broader populations and different geographic regions, fostering a long-term global impact.
