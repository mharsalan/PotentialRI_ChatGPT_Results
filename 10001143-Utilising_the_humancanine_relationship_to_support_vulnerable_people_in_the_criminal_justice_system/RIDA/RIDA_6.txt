After reading the provided text from the study and aligning it with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I will now outline the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Facility Dogs as a Tool for Building Rapport and Credibility with Child Witnesses".

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study impacts several key domains:

Legal Domain: The study contributes to improving legal practices by incorporating facility dogs into child witness interviews, enhancing rapport and witness credibility in sensitive cases (page 2)​(6). This could influence the adoption of these practices within legal systems globally.
Social Domain: Facility dogs support vulnerable populations such as children who have experienced trauma, leading to better communication during police interviews and reducing stress, ultimately benefiting the broader social welfare system (pages 1-2)​(6).
Health Domain: The emotional and psychological well-being of child witnesses is enhanced through the presence of facility dogs, which can reduce anxiety and improve overall mental health outcomes for trauma survivors (page 3)​(6).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The immediate effects include better cooperation and communication from child witnesses during police interviews. Facility dogs create a more comfortable and safe environment, which leads to more credible testimony (page 5)​(6).
Long-term Impact: In the long term, the study could influence changes in policy and legal practices, leading to widespread adoption of facility dogs across different legal systems globally (pages 4-6)​(6). This could have lasting implications for how child witnesses and vulnerable individuals are treated during legal proceedings.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
Child witnesses: These are the primary beneficiaries of the intervention, as facility dogs directly improve their ability to communicate and reduce stress during interviews (page 2)​(6).
Law enforcement and legal professionals: By improving the quality of witness testimony, these stakeholders benefit from more reliable evidence, leading to better case outcomes (page 2)​(6).
Indirect Stakeholders:
Families of victims: They benefit indirectly from better legal outcomes and reduced stress for child witnesses.
Policymakers and child advocacy groups: This research provides data to advocate for more child-friendly practices in legal systems.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a profound impact on the niche area of forensic interviewing and child psychology, by introducing facility dogs as a therapeutic tool to support child witnesses (page 3)​(6).
Broad Impact: Beyond the legal field, the study’s findings have implications for healthcare, mental health services, and other sectors that support vulnerable individuals, showing that facility dogs could be used in a variety of high-stress settings (page 5)​(6).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The model of using facility dogs in police interviews can be scaled up to other parts of the criminal justice system, such as courtrooms and pre-trial processes (page 5)​(6). The concept can be extended beyond child witnesses to include other vulnerable populations like the elderly or individuals with mental health disorders.
Transferability: This approach can be transferred to other high-stress environments, such as hospitals or schools, where facility dogs can support individuals in stressful or traumatic situations (page 6)​(6).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: Introducing facility dogs into police interviews is an innovative approach that enhances the rapport-building process between child witnesses and law enforcement (page 5)​(6). The use of trained dogs as a psychological support tool is a relatively new concept in legal systems, especially outside of North America, making it a novel intervention.
Disruption: This research has the potential to disrupt traditional forensic interview methods by showing that non-human, empathetic support (i.e., facility dogs) can significantly improve witness credibility and emotional well-being, shifting the paradigm in how vulnerable witnesses are treated (page 6)​(6).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: Facility dogs are a cost-effective, low-resource intervention that can provide ongoing emotional support with minimal infrastructure. The ethical considerations around the care and welfare of the dogs, as well as the protection of child witnesses, make this a sustainable and ethical practice (page 5)​(6).
Ethical Considerations: The study highlights the importance of ensuring that child witnesses voluntarily engage with facility dogs and that the dogs are handled in ways that prioritize their well-being, ensuring that the intervention is humane and respectful to all parties involved (page 6)​(6).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The integration of facility dogs into police interviews is shown to be a practical and easily implementable intervention. The research provides clear guidelines on how facility dogs can be introduced without disrupting legal processes (page 6)​(6).
Usability: Law enforcement agencies and child protection professionals can readily adopt this intervention, as it does not require significant changes to existing procedures. The positive feedback from practitioners in North America suggests high usability (page 6)​(6).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research bridges the fields of psychology, law enforcement, animal-assisted therapy, and social work, showing broad interdisciplinary relevance. It provides insights for professionals across these domains, leading to improved practices in multiple sectors (page 7)​(6).
Global Relevance: The study’s findings are relevant to legal systems worldwide, particularly in countries seeking to improve child witness care and trauma-informed practices in legal settings. It can be adapted to diverse legal and cultural contexts, especially in regions with developing child protection systems (page 7)​(6).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The intervention is resilient to changes in the legal landscape and can be adapted to various legal and social systems. Facility dogs can be used flexibly in a range of environments, making the approach adaptable to different procedural and cultural contexts (page 7)​(6).
Adaptability: Beyond legal settings, facility dogs can be used in hospitals, schools, and counseling services. The study suggests that the intervention is adaptable for different vulnerable populations, not just child witnesses (page 7)​(6).
Conclusion
This study has the potential to create deep, long-lasting impacts across legal, social, and health domains. It offers a scalable and transferable solution for supporting vulnerable individuals in high-stress environments. By introducing facility dogs into forensic interviews, the research contributes to innovation in how law enforcement and social services care for child witnesses. The findings are applicable to global contexts, making this a widely relevant study with profound implications for trauma-informed care across disciplines.
