Based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" and the provided study, I will now give a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions for the study "The Use of Facility Dogs to Bridge the Justice Gap for Survivors of Sexual Offending" by Elizabeth Spruin and colleagues.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
This study touches upon multiple domains:

Health Domain: The use of facility dogs to provide emotional support for survivors of sexual offenses helps mitigate stress and anxiety during police interviews. This intervention has clear mental health benefits, aiding in trauma recovery (page 2)​(5).
Social Domain: This research addresses a critical gap in how survivors of sexual crimes engage with the criminal justice system, aiming to enhance survivors' well-being and engagement with the legal process, potentially leading to higher rates of reporting and participation (page 1)​(5).
Legal Domain: By focusing on how facility dogs can improve the survivor’s courtroom experience, the study may influence policy changes in how the criminal justice system approaches the treatment of vulnerable individuals (pages 1-2)​(5).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: The immediate effects include improved emotional states for survivors during stressful situations such as police interviews, which may directly lead to better quality testimonies and a more humane experience for survivors (page 9)​(5).
Long-term Impact: The research lays the groundwork for potential long-term policy changes that institutionalize the use of facility dogs across police and legal systems to support survivors of sexual violence (pages 8-10)​(5).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Direct Stakeholders: Survivors of sexual offenses are the primary beneficiaries, as they receive emotional support during stressful police interviews, improving their experience within the justice system (page 7)​(5).
Indirect Stakeholders: Law enforcement officers and legal professionals also benefit, as the facility dogs help reduce the emotional burden on survivors, allowing for more coherent and complete testimonies, ultimately improving case outcomes (page 7)​(5).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: This research has a deep impact on the niche field of trauma support within the criminal justice system, providing evidence for the psychological benefits of animal-assisted interventions for vulnerable individuals during police interviews (page 10)​(5).
Breadth: The findings can influence not just legal settings but also other high-stress environments, such as healthcare and educational institutions, where vulnerable individuals require emotional support (page 10)​(5).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study demonstrates that the use of facility dogs can be scaled to other parts of the criminal justice system beyond police interviews, including courtrooms and post-trial proceedings, where survivors need support (pages 10-12)​(5).
Transferability: The approach can be transferred to other sectors, such as mental health and education, where animal-assisted therapy could provide similar emotional and psychological benefits to individuals under stress (page 10)​(5).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: Introducing facility dogs to police interviews is a novel intervention in the UK, building on successful programs from the U.S. and Canada. This represents an innovative approach to survivor support, moving beyond traditional methods such as video testimonies (page 5)​(5).
Disruption: The study could disrupt traditional police and legal practices by integrating emotional support animals into formal legal procedures, potentially leading to significant changes in how survivors of sexual violence are treated during legal proceedings (page 8)​(5).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The use of facility dogs is a sustainable intervention as it requires relatively low resource investment after the dogs are trained. It offers long-term benefits by improving survivor engagement with the criminal justice system without requiring major infrastructural changes (page 9)​(5).
Ethical Considerations: The study carefully considers ethical guidelines, ensuring that the survivors’ well-being is prioritized and that the facility dogs are appropriately trained and used in settings where their presence is beneficial (page 7)​(5).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study shows that facility dogs can be easily integrated into existing legal and police systems with minimal disruption. Clear guidelines on the use of the dogs make the intervention practical and feasible for widespread adoption (page 10)​(5).
Usability: Facility dogs are well-received by survivors and law enforcement alike, making this a highly usable intervention that can be adopted in other legal and high-stress environments (page 10)​(5).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research is relevant across disciplines, including psychology, law enforcement, animal-assisted therapy, and social work. The interdisciplinary nature of the study means it can influence multiple fields related to trauma support and survivor engagement (page 6)​(5).
Global Relevance: The study’s findings are globally relevant, particularly for countries looking to reform their justice systems to provide better support to survivors of sexual offenses. The model can be adapted for use in diverse legal and cultural contexts worldwide (page 5)​(5).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The intervention shows resilience by being adaptable to various legal settings and high-stress environments, ensuring its applicability in different courts and police departments regardless of size or location (pages 9-10)​(5).
Adaptability: Facility dogs can be easily adapted for use in other environments beyond police interviews, such as medical settings where patients might need emotional support during stressful procedures (page 10)​(5).
Conclusion
The study on the use of facility dogs to support survivors of sexual offenses demonstrates significant potential to influence multiple domains, including health, legal, and social sectors. It provides both short-term benefits by improving survivor engagement with police interviews and long-term potential for policy changes that institutionalize the use of facility dogs. The study's findings can be scaled across the criminal justice system and transferred to other sectors where emotional support is needed, offering a resilient and adaptable solution for trauma support in high-stress environments.
