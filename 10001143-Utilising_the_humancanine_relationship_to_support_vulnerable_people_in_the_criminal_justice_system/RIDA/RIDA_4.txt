Based on the information extracted from your study and aligning with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I will provide a detailed analysis of the research impacts across these dimensions. This breakdown will assess how your study, “Dogs in the Criminal Justice System: Consideration of Facility and Therapy Dogs,” achieves or can achieve impact in various domains.

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study has potential impacts across multiple domains:

Social Domain: This research enhances understanding of how facility and therapy dogs can alleviate stress for vulnerable populations in court settings (victims, witnesses, defendants). It contributes to the improvement of social policies by offering emotional support for individuals navigating high-stress situations like legal testimonies (pages 2-4)​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Health Domain: The study discusses the role of therapy and facility dogs in reducing anxiety, pain, and improving emotional well-being. This aligns with public health goals, specifically in psychological and emotional care (pages 2-4).
Legal Domain: The research directly influences the criminal justice system, suggesting practical reforms for how courts support vulnerable individuals by introducing therapy or facility dogs, which could lead to shifts in judicial practices (pages 5-7)​(4).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study offers immediate application by advocating for the use of trained dogs in courtroom environments, helping improve the quality of testimony and court experiences for vulnerable individuals.
Long-term Impact: Over time, this research has the potential to influence how judicial systems worldwide adopt emotional support mechanisms, embedding therapy and facility dogs as part of formal witness protection measures (page 6)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Victims, witnesses, and court personnel (e.g., judges, lawyers) are the direct beneficiaries. The study shows how therapy and facility dogs can ease the emotional burden of legal proceedings on these individuals.
Indirect Stakeholders: Indirectly, the criminal justice system and society benefit as the use of dogs could lead to better outcomes in legal processes by improving the emotional well-being of key participants, potentially resulting in clearer and more effective testimonies (page 6)​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: The study deeply influences the field of criminal justice by offering innovative ways to support emotional well-being in courtrooms, particularly in sensitive cases like those involving children or victims of sexual offences (pages 6-7)​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Breadth of Impact: While its core impact is within the judicial system, the concepts could be broadened to other sectors, such as education, healthcare, or social services, where similar emotional support interventions may be needed (page 5).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The research demonstrates that the use of therapy and facility dogs can be scaled across various courts globally. The practical framework provided for training and implementation makes this intervention scalable to both small local courts and large national judicial systems (page 7)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: Beyond courtrooms, the research findings are transferable to other high-stress environments such as hospitals, schools, or social service offices where vulnerable individuals might need similar support (page 3)​(4).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a novel approach to supporting vulnerable individuals in the justice system through animal-assisted interventions, moving beyond traditional methods of witness protection (pages 2-4)​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: This research has disruptive potential by challenging conventional courtroom practices and introducing animals into formal legal environments. If widely adopted, therapy and facility dogs could transform how courts support vulnerable individuals, leading to more humane and psychologically supportive processes (page 6)​(4).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The use of therapy and facility dogs is a cost-effective and non-invasive intervention that can be sustained over time with minimal infrastructure changes. The low-cost nature of these interventions, once training is established, makes them a viable long-term solution for courts (page 5).
Ethical Considerations: Ethical concerns regarding the welfare of both the dogs and the individuals they support are well addressed. The study suggests clear guidelines for how facility dogs should be trained, treated, and deployed to ensure the well-being of both human and canine participants (page 4)​(4).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research demonstrates that therapy dogs can be easily integrated into existing courtroom infrastructure without significant procedural changes. Clear guidelines for training and use make the intervention feasible for quick adoption across various legal settings (page 7)​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The research shows that therapy dogs are well-received by court users and staff, with high satisfaction levels. The intervention is straightforward to apply, making it highly usable in different court systems (page 6).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research has implications for multiple fields, including psychology, law, animal therapy, and social work. It brings together knowledge from these fields to propose a cross-disciplinary solution for supporting vulnerable populations in high-stress environments (page 5)​(4).
Global Relevance: While the study primarily focuses on the UK and North America, its findings are relevant globally. Countries with similar judicial systems can adopt these practices to improve the treatment of vulnerable individuals in their courts (page 7)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The intervention shows resilience by adapting to different court environments and stress levels. The use of specially trained dogs ensures that they remain calm and effective even in high-stress situations, making the intervention resilient to fluctuations in courtroom dynamics (page 6).
Adaptability: The principles of using therapy dogs can be adapted to various other environments beyond courts, such as schools or hospitals, showing strong adaptability to different high-stress settings where vulnerable individuals need emotional support (page 7)​(4).
Conclusion
The study on the use of therapy and facility dogs in the criminal justice system demonstrates strong potential to influence multiple domains—social, legal, health, and educational. It has both short- and long-term impacts, scalable and transferable solutions, and a strong potential to innovate and disrupt traditional courtroom practices. By addressing key ethical considerations and offering clear guidelines for implementation, the study presents a practical and sustainable model for improving emotional well-being in legal settings, with potential for global adoption and cross-disciplinary applications.
