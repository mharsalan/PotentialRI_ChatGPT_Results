Based on a detailed reading of the uploaded study and aligning it with research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts, mapped to established impact categories:

1. Domains of Research Impact
This research touches multiple domains:

Social Domain: The use of facility dogs improves the experiences of child witnesses in legal settings, enhancing the social welfare system by providing emotional support to vulnerable children (page 2). This promotes better societal care for trauma-affected individuals​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Legal Domain: It directly influences legal procedures by integrating therapy animals into witness interviews, particularly for children in cases of sexual assault or other traumas, thus affecting legal outcomes by improving testimony quality and courtroom processes​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Health Domain: The emotional support provided by facility dogs contributes to the mental well-being of child witnesses, potentially reducing trauma-related symptoms, thereby intersecting with health and well-being dimensions​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The immediate outcome is improved engagement of child witnesses during police interviews, which results in more reliable and complete testimonies. This contributes to the effectiveness of legal investigations and court proceedings (page 3)​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research could lead to the institutionalization of facility dogs in various legal systems globally, transforming how vulnerable populations, such as children, engage with justice systems​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The primary beneficiaries are the child witnesses who experience emotional and psychological relief from stress during interviews. Law enforcement officers and legal practitioners also benefit from better cooperation from witnesses, which leads to higher-quality testimony (page 3)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Indirect Stakeholders: Families of child witnesses and broader society benefit indirectly, as more effective witness testimony can lead to better justice outcomes and a reduction in the emotional trauma experienced by the children involved​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The research deeply impacts the legal system's approach to trauma-informed care for vulnerable populations, specifically in how child witnesses are supported during stressful legal processes. This could transform forensic practices and legal procedures globally (page 4)​(Research impact toolkit).
Breadth: While focused on child witnesses, the use of therapy dogs can be extended to other areas such as healthcare (e.g., providing support to trauma survivors or patients with chronic illnesses), making the findings relevant across multiple sectors​(impact pathway).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The model of using facility dogs can be scaled to other parts of the justice system, including courtrooms and pre-trial interviews. This model can also be scaled to other countries and legal jurisdictions that wish to improve trauma-informed care for vulnerable populations (page 6)​(impact pathway).
Transferability: The intervention is easily transferable to other sectors such as healthcare and education, where emotional support for vulnerable individuals is crucial​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: This study introduces a novel approach to witness support by integrating animal-assisted interventions into legal proceedings, moving away from traditional, purely human-driven support systems (page 5). It opens up new methods for engaging child witnesses in trauma-informed ways​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Disruption: The research challenges existing witness testimony practices by showing that facility dogs can significantly enhance the emotional well-being and credibility of child witnesses, potentially disrupting traditional forensic interviewing models​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: Facility dogs are a cost-effective intervention once trained, offering long-term benefits with minimal additional resources. The ethical considerations around ensuring the well-being of both the child witnesses and the therapy dogs are carefully addressed, making this a sustainable practice (page 7)​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Ethical Considerations: The research emphasizes the voluntary engagement of children with the facility dogs, ensuring that the animals are handled with care and respect. This ethical approach ensures that the practice remains humane and beneficial for all involved​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research demonstrates that facility dogs can be easily integrated into legal systems with minimal disruption to existing processes. The clear guidelines provided for integrating dogs into police interviews make this intervention practical and feasible for widespread adoption​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Usability: Legal professionals and law enforcement can readily adopt the use of facility dogs, as demonstrated in successful case studies in North America. This usability ensures that the intervention can be implemented in diverse legal environments with relative ease​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The research bridges psychology, law, animal-assisted therapy, and social work, creating an interdisciplinary framework that can be applied across these fields. This cross-disciplinary nature increases its relevance and utility across sectors​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Global Relevance: While the study is based on legal systems in specific regions, its findings are globally applicable, particularly for countries aiming to improve trauma-informed care and child protection systems. This makes the study highly relevant for international adoption​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The use of facility dogs demonstrates resilience to changes in the legal landscape. The intervention can adapt to different legal contexts, including courtrooms, investigative settings, and beyond. The adaptability of this model allows it to remain relevant in changing legal and social environments (page 8)​(Research impact toolkit).
Adaptability: The research shows that facility dogs can be adapted for use not only with child witnesses but also with other vulnerable populations, such as survivors of sexual violence, elderly individuals, and those with cognitive impairments, expanding the applicability of the findings across various contexts​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive framework for integrating facility dogs into legal processes to support child witnesses, with potential applications in other sectors such as healthcare and education. The research impacts span multiple domains—legal, social, and health—while offering both short-term benefits (e.g., improved witness testimony) and long-term systemic changes (e.g., policy reforms and institutional adoption). Its scalability, ethical approach, and global relevance make it a transformative model for trauma-informed care, with significant potential to disrupt traditional legal and support systems.
