Based on my review of the study "The Use of Facility Dogs to Bridge the Justice Gap for Survivors of Sexual Offending", here are the detailed potential research impacts of the study, aligned with research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study influences multiple domains:

Social Domain: This research addresses a crucial social issue—improving the support for survivors of sexual offenses within the justice system. Facility dogs provide emotional support, helping survivors to engage more fully with the legal process. This addresses a pressing societal need to make the criminal justice system more accessible and less traumatic for vulnerable individuals​(5)​(Common Research Impact …).
Health Domain: By helping survivors manage stress and trauma, the study contributes to better psychological outcomes for these individuals. The use of facility dogs may reduce post-traumatic stress and anxiety, which are prevalent among survivors of sexual violence​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
Legal Domain: The research has a direct influence on the criminal justice system. By demonstrating that facility dogs improve the quality of survivor interviews and their willingness to participate in legal proceedings, the study has the potential to inform policies that institutionalize the use of support animals in the justice process​(5)​(impact pathway).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediately, the introduction of facility dogs could improve the emotional experience of survivors during police interviews, making them feel more comfortable and willing to participate fully in investigations​(5)​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-term Impact: In the long term, this research could lead to systemic changes in how survivors of sexual offenses are treated by the justice system. Over time, these changes could be codified into policy, ensuring that facility dogs become a standard part of witness support in courts across the UK and other jurisdictions​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Survivors of sexual offenses, law enforcement, legal professionals, and support workers. Survivors benefit from the emotional and psychological support provided by facility dogs, while legal professionals benefit from improved engagement and testimony from survivors​(5)​(Common Research Impact …).
Indirect Stakeholders: The broader community, as improving the criminal justice system for survivors of sexual offenses contributes to a more compassionate and effective legal system. Policymakers and advocacy groups are also indirect beneficiaries, as this research informs future policies and reforms​(5)​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The study deeply impacts how vulnerable individuals, specifically survivors of sexual violence, experience the criminal justice process. By integrating facility dogs into police interviews, the research profoundly changes the emotional landscape of these high-stress interactions, helping survivors feel safer and more supported​(5)​(impact pathway).
Breadth: While the research primarily impacts the criminal justice system, it has broader implications for other sectors where vulnerable populations may benefit from animal-assisted therapy, such as healthcare and social services​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The findings of this research could be scaled across various jurisdictions and courts. While the study focuses on facility dogs in police interviews, the model could easily be expanded to other areas of the justice system, such as courtrooms and post-trial victim support​(5)​(Common Research Impact …).
Transferability: The principles of using facility dogs to provide emotional support can be transferred to other high-stress environments, such as hospitals, schools, and social service agencies. These applications make the research highly transferable across different sectors​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: Introducing facility dogs to support survivors of sexual offenses during police interviews is an innovative approach to trauma-informed care within the justice system. It represents a shift from traditional methods of witness support, such as video testimonies, toward a more emotionally supportive environment​(5)​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruption: This research challenges conventional methods of victim support in legal settings, offering a new, empathetic approach. It could disrupt the way legal systems across the globe approach survivor care, making them more humane and emotionally responsive​(5)​(impact pathway).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The use of facility dogs is a low-cost and sustainable intervention that requires minimal resources beyond initial training and care for the animals. Once trained, the dogs can provide ongoing emotional support without needing extensive infrastructure changes​(5)​(Common Research Impact …).
Ethical Considerations: The study emphasizes the ethical treatment of both survivors and the facility dogs. Ethical protocols ensure that survivors are given the choice to engage with the dogs, and the dogs themselves are treated humanely and with respect for their welfare​(5)​(impact pathway).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The integration of facility dogs into police interview processes is practical and can be implemented with relative ease. The study provides clear guidelines on how to introduce dogs into legal settings without disrupting the investigative process​(5)​(Research impact toolkit).
Usability: The findings of this research can be easily adopted by law enforcement and judicial systems. The positive responses from survivors and law enforcement alike suggest that this intervention is both feasible and widely applicable​(5)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research intersects with multiple fields, including psychology, law enforcement, social work, and animal therapy. The interdisciplinary nature of the study means that it can influence practices in both the legal and healthcare sectors​(5)​(Research impact toolkit).
Global Relevance: While the study is based in the UK, its findings are applicable globally. Other countries facing similar challenges in supporting survivors of sexual offenses can adapt these methods to their legal systems, making the study relevant to international criminal justice reforms​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The intervention is resilient to changes in the legal and social landscape. Facility dogs can be adapted to different legal settings, including both in-person and video-recorded testimonies, making them versatile tools for survivor support​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Adaptability: Beyond police interviews, facility dogs can be used in courtrooms, medical settings, and social services. The study’s findings suggest that this approach is adaptable to various contexts where vulnerable individuals require emotional support​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Conclusion
The study on facility dogs in the criminal justice system has wide-reaching implications across social, legal, and health domains. It offers both short-term benefits, such as improved emotional states for survivors, and long-term potential to influence policy changes and legal reforms. The study’s findings are scalable and transferable to other sectors, making it a sustainable and adaptable solution for trauma support in high-stress environments.
