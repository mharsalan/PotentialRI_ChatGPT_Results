After thoroughly reviewing the study "The Use of Therapy Dogs to Support Court Users in the Waiting Room," the following potential research impacts can be identified across multiple dimensions of research impact as aligned with predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
This research has potential impacts in several key domains:

Social Domain: The study explores how therapy dogs can reduce stress and anxiety in court settings, which contributes to improving the well-being of court users, including witnesses, victims, and other participants. The findings can influence public awareness and support programs aimed at improving mental health in stressful environments such as courtrooms​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Criminal Justice Domain: By highlighting the effectiveness of therapy dogs in alleviating stress, this research has the potential to influence court procedures and legal policy in the UK, particularly regarding support for vulnerable witnesses​(1). This may lead to reforms in how courts provide emotional support.
Health and Well-being Domain: Therapy dog interventions can significantly contribute to the mental health of individuals in stressful environments, potentially being adopted in broader health settings like hospitals or crisis centers​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: In the near future, this study can lead to the immediate adoption of therapy dogs in specific courts where vulnerable witnesses need emotional support. Its short-term influence is likely to be felt in local criminal justice systems, especially as it addresses immediate emotional needs in high-stress environments​(1).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research could lay the groundwork for national reforms in how courts across the UK and potentially internationally manage vulnerable populations. Therapy dogs could become a standard support practice in courtrooms, improving the experience for countless individuals​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Court users, including witnesses, victims, and defendants, are direct beneficiaries as therapy dogs help reduce anxiety and trauma while waiting to give evidence​(1). Court staff and judges also benefit from having calmer participants, which can improve the overall courtroom experience and efficiency.
Indirect Stakeholders: Policy-makers and mental health professionals are indirectly impacted as they may use these findings to advocate for broader mental health initiatives within the legal system and beyond​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study could have a transformative impact on the criminal justice system by changing how courts support vulnerable populations, particularly through non-traditional methods like therapy dogs​(1).
Broad Impact: Beyond the legal system, the research has the potential to influence healthcare and social welfare policies, particularly in fields that intersect with mental health, trauma, and emotional support in high-stress environments​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study's findings can be scaled to apply therapy dog interventions across the entire criminal justice system in the UK and globally, reaching a larger population over time​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Transferability: The principles of using therapy animals to support vulnerable individuals can be transferred to other high-stress settings, such as hospitals, schools, or rehabilitation centers, expanding its impact on mental health interventions​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: This research introduces therapy dogs into the UK criminal justice system, a novel approach in this context. It represents an innovative way to reduce the emotional burden on witnesses, particularly vulnerable populations​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruption: If widely adopted, therapy dogs could disrupt traditional court practices, leading to a more humane and psychologically supportive legal environment. This could revolutionize the approach to witness care during trials, particularly in sensitive or traumatic cases​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: Therapy dogs offer a low-cost, sustainable solution to emotional and psychological support needs within the courtroom. They provide long-term benefits without significant ongoing costs, making this intervention ethically sound and financially viable for widespread implementation​(Common Research Impact …).
Ethical Considerations: The ethical treatment of therapy dogs and the focus on supporting vulnerable witnesses align with social justice principles, ensuring that the intervention is supportive without causing harm​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The practical application of therapy dogs is straightforward, as the study demonstrates clear benefits to court users with minimal infrastructure requirements. Therapy dogs can be easily integrated into court environments with training and procedural adjustments​(1)​(Research impact toolkit).
Usability: The therapy dog intervention can be used in various court settings with diverse cases, making it highly usable across different legal contexts​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: This research intersects with fields such as psychology, law, social work, and animal therapy, making it relevant to a wide range of disciplines​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
Global Relevance: The findings can be applied globally, particularly in countries exploring innovative ways to support vulnerable populations in high-stress legal environments​(impact pathway).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The use of therapy dogs is resilient to changes in courtroom conditions, as the research shows they can adapt to various situations and environments without losing their effectiveness​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Adaptability: Therapy dogs are highly adaptable to different types of court cases and user needs, making this a versatile intervention that can meet diverse challenges in the justice system​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Public Awareness and Education
Public Engagement: This study can enhance public understanding of emotional support in legal settings, potentially driving further engagement and advocacy for the use of therapy animals in other high-stress environments​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Conclusion:
The study "The Use of Therapy Dogs to Support Court Users in the Waiting Room" demonstrates multiple research impacts, ranging from immediate social and psychological benefits to broader legal reforms and cross-disciplinary applications.
