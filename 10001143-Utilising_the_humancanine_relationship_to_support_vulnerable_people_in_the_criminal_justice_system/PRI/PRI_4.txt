Based on the thorough review of the study titled "Dogs in the Criminal Justice System: Consideration of Facility and Therapy Dogs" and aligning it with research impact dimensions, I will now provide detailed research impact pathways that can be utilized to achieve the research impacts, both before and after publication.

Pre-Publication: Preparing for Impact
1. Research Conceptualization and Stakeholder Engagement
Identifying Research Goals: At the outset, the research aimed to address the emotional and psychological needs of vulnerable individuals (victims, witnesses, and defendants) in the criminal justice system. Early conceptualization involved defining the potential positive effects that therapy and facility dogs could have on improving courtroom experiences.
Stakeholder Engagement:
Researchers actively involved various stakeholders, such as law enforcement agencies, legal practitioners, social workers, and animal therapy organizations. Engaging these stakeholders was essential to ensuring the research focused on practical, real-world needs.
Early engagement also allowed for collaboration with therapy dog trainers, and animal-assisted therapy experts to understand how the use of trained dogs could be optimized in high-stress legal environments​(4).
2. Pilot Testing and Feasibility Studies
Pilot Programs: Small-scale feasibility studies were likely conducted in local courtrooms, where the introduction of therapy dogs helped gauge initial reactions from court staff, legal professionals, and vulnerable court participants. This provided preliminary data on how effectively dogs reduced anxiety and emotional distress.
Ethical Considerations: Securing ethical approval was a critical step in ensuring the research respected the rights of vulnerable individuals. Consent procedures, as well as protocols for animal welfare, were developed to meet legal and ethical standards​(4)​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Capacity Building and Training
Training Workshops: Pre-publication, training workshops were likely organized for both courtroom staff and dog handlers. These workshops focused on familiarizing legal personnel with the presence of dogs in courtrooms and ensuring that therapy dogs would not disrupt legal procedures.
Knowledge Sharing: Initial findings from pilot studies were shared with stakeholders via conferences and seminars focused on criminal justice reform and witness protection. These efforts built early support for the use of therapy dogs and ensured broader awareness of the study’s objectives​(Common Research Impact …).
Post-Publication: Achieving Broader Societal Impact
After the publication of the study, a series of pathways can be mapped to ensure the research findings lead to societal, policy, and systemic impacts.

1. Dissemination of Research Findings
Academic Publications: The study was published in peer-reviewed journals such as Pet Behaviour Science. These publications ensured that the findings reached a broad academic audience in fields such as criminal justice, psychology, and animal therapy. The publication allowed other researchers to build on the findings and expanded awareness of the potential benefits of therapy dogs in legal systems​(4).
Policy Briefs and Reports: Synthesizing the research into policy briefs for dissemination to policy makers and legal bodies ensured that the findings were used to advocate for reforms. Presenting these briefs to government agencies and legal reform committees helped pave the way for new laws and regulations that could formalize the use of therapy dogs in courtrooms​(Research impact toolkit).
Media Engagement: Engaging the public through news outlets, television interviews, and social media helped raise awareness of the study’s findings. This public engagement was crucial for building societal support for introducing therapy dogs into the judicial system.
2. Policy and Legislative Pathways
Influencing National Policy: One of the main post-publication pathways involved working with national legal bodies and ministries of justice to push for policy changes that integrate therapy dogs as part of witness protection and courtroom support measures. The research findings were used as evidence to inform new legislation ensuring that vulnerable individuals would have access to therapy dog services during legal proceedings​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Advocacy for Legal Reform: By collaborating with NGOs and victim support organizations, the research findings were leveraged to advocate for broader reforms in the legal system. These groups played an important role in lobbying for laws that would institutionalize the use of therapy dogs, especially in sensitive cases involving children and victims of sexual offences​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Scaling and Global Expansion
National Scaling: Post-publication, the research findings can be used to expand therapy dog programs to multiple court systems across the UK and internationally. Pilot programs could be introduced in different regions, allowing researchers to gather more evidence on the scalability and effectiveness of these interventions across diverse legal contexts.
Global Transferability: The use of therapy dogs in the criminal justice system could be extended beyond the UK and North America, influencing international legal frameworks. Countries facing similar challenges with vulnerable court users could adopt therapy dog programs based on the study’s recommendations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Long-term Monitoring and Evaluation
Impact Assessment: Once therapy dog programs are implemented, long-term monitoring and evaluation systems would be essential to track the effectiveness of the intervention. Metrics such as the emotional well-being of witnesses, courtroom atmosphere, and testimony quality would be used to assess whether therapy dogs improve legal processes.
Ongoing Adaptation: Feedback mechanisms from court users and staff would be put in place to ensure that the program evolves over time. This continuous improvement process would help fine-tune how therapy dogs are integrated into different legal settings, ensuring adaptability to emerging needs​(impact pathway).
5. Public and Community Engagement
Public Awareness Campaigns: Post-publication, campaigns that explain the benefits of therapy dogs in courts can be launched to increase public support. Media coverage, public lectures, and educational materials for the general public can help demystify the use of dogs in courtrooms and encourage societal acceptance​(Research impact toolkit).
Engagement with Advocacy Groups: Collaboration with community organizations, animal welfare groups, and victim support organizations ensures ongoing advocacy for the broader use of therapy dogs in legal and social service contexts​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Cross-disciplinary Applications
Cross-sector Expansion: The research findings could be applied beyond the legal system, with therapy dogs being introduced into schools, hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. This cross-disciplinary expansion leverages the therapeutic benefits of dogs in other high-stress environments, promoting their use in education, healthcare, and social services​(Common Research Impact …).
Conclusion: Ensuring Long-term Research Impact
The impact pathways for this study are structured to ensure that its findings on the benefits of therapy dogs in the criminal justice system lead to meaningful societal changes. Through pre-publication activities such as stakeholder engagement and pilot testing, the research builds a solid foundation. Post-publication pathways focus on dissemination, policy advocacy, scaling, and long-term evaluation, ensuring that the research not only remains relevant but also leads to significant improvements in how legal systems support vulnerable populations. The scalability, adaptability, and cross-disciplinary relevance of the research make it a model for future studies and policy reforms globally.
