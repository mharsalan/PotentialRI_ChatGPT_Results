Example: It helps preserve the legacy of the Lady Haig poppy factory, engaging not only historians but also general audiences, thus supporting both cultural preservation and active engagement with history.
3. Educational Impact
New Educational Tools: The VR experience offers a unique educational tool that can be used in classrooms, museums, and public history contexts to teach younger audiences about wartime history. By offering an interactive, immersive learning experience, it enhances students' understanding of historical events, potentially increasing interest in history and related subjects.
Example: The project can be adopted by schools and educational programs focused on World War history, improving educational outcomes by offering a more interactive learning platform.
4. Technological Impact
Innovation in Historical Representation: The use of VR as a storytelling medium for historical preservation showcases the disruptive potential of immersive technologies in the field of cultural history. The study demonstrates how VR can innovate traditional forms of memorialization.
Example: This innovative application of VR may lead to further technological advancements in how history is taught and experienced, with potential commercial applications in museums and educational software development.
5. Economic and Commercial Impact
Potential for Technological Commercialization: The development of this VR experience could lead to further commercialization of similar VR applications. These could be deployed in museums, cultural institutions, and even educational platforms, contributing to the digital economy, particularly in sectors related to heritage tourism and educational technology.
Example: Future applications could include paid experiences or educational packages designed for schools, helping to generate revenue and support further technological innovations.
6. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Cultural and Educational Policies: By demonstrating the value of innovative approaches to historical education, this study could influence policy-making in the cultural and educational sectors. It may encourage governments or cultural institutions to invest in new technologies for the preservation of historical and cultural memory.
Example: The project could shape policies related to heritage preservation and the use of technology in education, advocating for broader support of VR and similar technologies in these fields.
7. Health and Well-being Impact
Emotional and Psychological Engagement: Engaging with wartime memories in a virtual setting can evoke emotional responses, potentially providing therapeutic benefits for veterans or individuals affected by war. The project could lead to further exploration of how immersive technologies support emotional well-being through historical connection and memorialization.
Example: The VR experience could be used in therapeutic contexts, such as for veterans who want to revisit their history or connect with their legacy in a more controlled, immersive way.
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Integration of Disciplines: This research lies at the intersection of history, technology, education, and psychology. By combining these fields, it offers a cross-disciplinary approach that could be replicated in various international contexts.
Example: The framework can be used globally, adapting the VR technology to different historical contexts and making it relevant to diverse cultures looking to preserve their unique histories.
9. Ethical and Sustainability Considerations
Ethical Representation of Memories: The careful and respectful portrayal of veterans' memories in a VR environment raises ethical considerations about how history is represented. The study handles these challenges by ensuring that veterans’ stories are conveyed accurately and with dignity.
Example: As a sustainable digital resource, the project contributes to long-term heritage preservation while navigating ethical issues related to representation and memory.
10. Community Engagement and Participation
Community Participation in Heritage: The VR project creates a platform for veterans and their families to share their stories with the wider community, fostering a sense of involvement and inclusion.
Example: The broader community engagement created by the project helps bring veterans’ stories to the public, fostering interaction between different generations and promoting communal remembrance.
11. Public Awareness and Education
Public Engagement with History: By offering the general public a more interactive means of engaging with history, the study helps foster a greater public understanding of veterans' experiences and war memories.
Example: The immersive experience may help to change how the public perceives and values veterans’ contributions, promoting awareness and possibly influencing public opinion on topics related to war commemoration.
Conclusion:
The study on using VR to engage audiences with wartime memories has significant and wide-ranging research impacts. It advances academic knowledge in VR applications, promotes cultural and social engagement, and supports educational and technological innovations. Furthermore, it fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, policy influence, and commercial potential, making it a relevant and impactful project on multiple fronts.
