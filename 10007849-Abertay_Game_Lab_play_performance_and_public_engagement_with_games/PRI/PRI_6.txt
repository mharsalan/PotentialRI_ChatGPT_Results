
Based on a thorough reading of the study and utilizing the research impact dimensions from various sources, I have organized the potential research impacts of the study as follows. The impact is structured across different categories, each representing specific dimensions of impact from the research.

1. Academic and Knowledge Impact
The study focuses on virtual reality (VR), walking simulators, and technostalgia, offering novel insights into how constrained environments in VR can affect player experiences. The academic contributions are substantial in the fields of game studies, media theory, and interaction design.

Contribution to Game Studies: It critiques existing frameworks in walking simulators and presents new ways of understanding VR's tactile experiences.
Media and Cultural Studies: This study bridges digital nostalgia and VR to offer theoretical frameworks on how past media technologies influence modern user interfaces.
2. Cultural and Social Impact
Technostalgia in VR: The exploration of nostalgia through VR affects cultural perspectives on retro gaming, user experiences, and how old technologies are reinterpreted in new mediums.
Influence on Cultural Production: The project’s minimalist approach to VR has the potential to inspire creators in interactive media and art installations to adopt simpler, more sustainable VR designs. This has broader cultural ramifications in terms of how art and technology can be merged to evoke emotions and memories.
3. Technological Innovation and Disruption
Innovation in Interaction Design: By critiquing the assumption that high-fidelity VR is required for meaningful user experiences, the study opens new avenues for innovation in low-tech VR that focuses on tactile and experiential elements rather than hyperrealism. This can disrupt current norms in the VR industry.
Technological Disruption: The study introduces an alternative to the prevailing narrative in the VR space that bigger and more immersive is always better, advocating for minimalistic, constrained environments that challenge user expectations and offer more thoughtful, slow-paced interaction.
4. Stakeholder Impact
The research is directly relevant to:

Game developers: Developers of independent and VR games can adopt the ideas presented about minimalism in game design.
Academics and theorists: Scholars in media studies, interactive design, and digital arts will find new conceptual tools to explore the intersection of technology and nostalgia.
Cultural institutions: Museums or galleries interested in digital art and interactive installations can draw from the study’s findings to craft more engaging and less resource-intensive VR experiences for audiences.
5. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary impact: The research blends game design, cultural studies, and digital technology, creating cross-disciplinary relevance that can impact a variety of fields including media theory, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction.
Global relevance: The discussion on technostalgia and the tactile VR experience has resonance across cultures, as nostalgia and retro-gaming are global phenomena. This positions the study as relevant to international conversations on how technology shapes user experiences across different societies.
6. Economic and Commercialization Potential
Potential for Commercialization: The simplified VR interface and tactile controllers discussed could lead to new commercial VR products, particularly in educational or therapy-related VR applications that require more sensory, grounded interaction.
Cost-effective Design: The study emphasizes resource-efficient VR technologies that could help small developers compete with high-budget VR experiences, potentially leading to cost reductions in VR development.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Impact
Sustainability in Design: By focusing on minimalist, resource-efficient VR setups, the study promotes environmentally sustainable design practices. This contrasts with the resource-heavy, graphics-intensive VR systems that dominate the market today, making it a relevant contribution to discussions on sustainable gaming and digital media.
Ethical Considerations: The study questions the ethics of pursuing consumer-centric, high-fidelity technologies at the expense of more affordable and accessible solutions, encouraging the industry to rethink the push for complexity and graphical prowess.
8. Long-term Impact and Knowledge Accumulation
Foundational for Future Research: The study lays the groundwork for future explorations in minimalist VR design and digital nostalgia. Its findings could guide academic discourse for years to come, influencing both theoretical research and practical game design strategies.
Knowledge dissemination: The research has the potential to influence pedagogy in game design courses or VR development programs by encouraging future designers to think about user experience beyond complex graphical fidelity.
9. Behavioral and Social Change
Influence on User Expectations: This study may shift how users perceive VR experiences, encouraging more reflective, slow-paced interaction. It could foster a movement away from hyper-engagement towards more meaningful, embodied experiences in VR, leading to changes in consumer behavior.
Impact on Player Behavior: As the study critiques the sensory limitations of modern VR, it could lead players to reconsider the value they place on immersion, promoting new habits of interaction in virtual environments.
10. Policy and Advocacy Impact
Policy Influence on Gaming and Tech Development: The study’s critique of hyperrealism and resource-heavy VR could encourage policy-makers and industry bodies to consider guidelines or standards that favor sustainable, low-impact technologies in gaming and media production.
Advocacy for Simplified Interfaces: It could serve as an advocacy tool for the adoption of more inclusive VR technologies, promoting the development of affordable VR systems that are accessible to a broader audience, especially in educational or low-resource settings.
This structured list shows how the study has far-reaching implications across multiple sectors and disciplines, ranging from game design to sustainability, cultural studies, and technological innovation. Each dimension of impact aligns with the study's contributions and provides potential avenues for further influence.
