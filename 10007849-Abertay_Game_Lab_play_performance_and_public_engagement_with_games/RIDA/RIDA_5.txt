
The document titled "Installations, Disruption of Technology, and Performing Play" by Lynn Love and Mona Bozdog provides an extensive analysis of social play design strategies and their applications through various practice-based projects from 2014 to 2020. The work emphasizes the social benefits of play, designing audience and site-specific strategies, and creating interventions that engage people. Based on this context, I will now assess the research's potential impact across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The portfolio contributes primarily to the academic domain by exploring play design and its social benefits within digital and analogue forms. It engages with multiple fields including "game design, pervasive games, street games, installation, video game curation, play theories, and user experience design" (Abstract, p. 1). It also crosses into the social domain, emphasizing social interaction and connection, particularly highlighted by its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Example: The research impacts the social domain by enhancing social interaction through play, evidenced by the partnership with Cadbury Heroes to promote social play during isolation periods caused by COVID-19.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The project's long-term influence lies in its "mapping of audience and site-specific design strategies that can be applied by other practitioners in the field" (Abstract, p. 1). This ensures ongoing relevance, especially in developing future play designs for social spaces.
Example: Long-term impact is demonstrated by the portfolio’s contribution to evolving practices in game design and social engagement, which other artists and designers can apply to similar contexts.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: Key stakeholders include artists and game designers, policymakers, and community groups engaged in urban play design. The work involves the public as active participants in its installations.
Example: Stakeholders like BBC and Cadbury Heroes benefited directly by incorporating social play strategies in public events and marketing during COVID-19 to combat isolation.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: Depth is observed in the research’s detailed exploration of "play design strategies within set design constraints" (Abstract, p. 1), while breadth is achieved through its impact across both digital and physical play environments.
Example: Broad impact includes the international showcase of installations, making it applicable in various cultural contexts, enhancing the global relevance of the play designs.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: The scalability is implied by the "large-scale installation for socially distant play at V&A Dundee" (Abstract, p. 1), showing the capacity for wider application of the design strategies. Transferability is noted through the design strategies being adaptable for different locations and participant needs.
Example: The play design strategies can be scaled for larger urban settings or transferred to new contexts, such as public health campaigns to promote social interaction in socially distanced environments.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: The work disrupts traditional perceptions of play by incorporating it into public art installations and urban settings, especially during the pandemic, a novel context for social play.
Example: The partnership with Cadbury Heroes illustrates disruptive potential by applying play concepts to a commercial marketing campaign, integrating play into everyday consumer experiences.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: The portfolio promotes social sustainability by addressing isolation and encouraging community interaction through play. Ethical considerations are apparent in the design’s focus on inclusive participation across different societal groups.
Example: The play strategies promote social well-being, particularly important during pandemic-induced isolation, demonstrating a commitment to improving mental health and community bonds sustainably.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: The findings have high usability for artists, designers, and community organizations looking to apply similar strategies in different urban or social contexts (Abstract, p. 1).
Example: The work was successfully implemented in large public events such as the installation at V&A Dundee, demonstrating ease of adaptation to various physical spaces.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: The research spans multiple fields including game design, social interaction, urban planning, and public health. Its relevance to global issues is illustrated by its focus on social interaction during a global health crisis (COVID-19 pandemic).
Example: The integration of social play into pandemic responses demonstrates its global relevance, providing strategies for addressing social isolation during crises in various cultural contexts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: The adaptability of the research is evidenced by its evolution to include strategies for socially distant play, addressing changing societal needs during the pandemic.
Example: The design strategies proved resilient by being applicable even during periods of restricted social contact, ensuring their relevance across changing public health contexts.
This detailed breakdown demonstrates the multifaceted impact of the research across multiple domains, particularly in addressing social challenges through innovative play design strategies.
