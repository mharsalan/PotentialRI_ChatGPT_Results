
Based on the research presented in the Inchcolm Project document and using the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact framework, here is the detailed assessment for each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The Inchcolm Project is part of an interdisciplinary research project that develops new ways of designing for the moving body across media, by combining aesthetics and design methods from contemporary performance practice and video games" (Abstract, p. 72)​(3).
"It brought a video game (Dear Esther, The Chinese Room, 2012) to life on a Scottish island (Inchcolm island in the Firth of Forth)" (Abstract, p. 72)​(3).
Example:

Academic Impact: The project combines contemporary performance practices and video game design, advancing interdisciplinary research within the arts and digital media studies.
Cultural Impact: It affects the cultural domain by preserving and reinterpreting heritage sites through creative performance, as seen in the use of Inchcolm Abbey for performances inspired by the game "Dear Esther."
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"In designing the performance, I wanted to use these ghosts as an additional connection to the world of the game in form, along with Inchcolm's troubled history" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Short-term Impact: The immediate cultural engagement by the audience/players and the performance will have a direct, short-term impact on how audiences engage with immersive performances.
Long-term Impact: The blending of digital and physical experiences could influence future interdisciplinary performance projects and how cultural heritage sites are utilized in the long term.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The performance was for an invited audience of 50 people from both performing arts and game design backgrounds" (Abstract, p. 72)​(3).
Example:

Direct Stakeholders: The direct beneficiaries include the audience, performance artists, game designers, and composers involved in the project.
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader communities such as digital media students, professionals in the arts, and tourism sectors (via cultural heritage enhancement) benefit indirectly.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"The Inchcolm Project aimed to make apparent the connections between video games and performance, and to blur the lines between physical and virtual worlds and bodies" (Abstract, p. 72)​(3).
Example:

Deep Impact: The project has a deep impact on interdisciplinary fields, specifically between gaming and performance art, by innovatively merging digital and physical performance spaces.
Broad Impact: This approach could inspire broader applications across various media forms, from virtual reality experiences to immersive storytelling.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"The audience/players wander freely on the island encountering geo-tagged audio, live music, performers, and installation spaces evocative of the game world" (Abstract, p. 72)​(3).
Example:

Scalability: The project could be scaled up by applying similar interdisciplinary techniques to other historical or natural sites, creating new tourism and performance models.
Transferability: The methods used to blend game design and live performance can be transferred to other sectors, such as education or therapeutic settings, where immersive experiences can enhance learning or healing.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"What resulted was an interplay between two islands: the physical one and the virtual one" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Innovation: This project introduces new ways to experience both video games and performance arts, particularly in the use of historical sites for live performances inspired by digital media.
Disruption: By breaking down the traditional boundaries between live performance and digital spaces, this project disrupts conventional models of audience interaction and cultural engagement.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The design of the performance intentionally used natural environmental elements like wind, rain, and light to change the atmosphere dynamically" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Sustainability: The project integrates the natural landscape as part of the performance, promoting sustainable use of cultural and natural resources.
Ethical Considerations: The project fosters ethical practices by reusing and respecting heritage sites, such as Inchcolm Abbey, ensuring their preservation and promoting public engagement with cultural history.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The installations were mostly on the right side of the island, and audience members were given maps to explore freely" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Implementation: The project demonstrates strong usability by providing clear methods for integrating game mechanics (geo-tagged audio, interactive environments) into physical spaces, making it adaptable for other locations or contexts.
Usability: The project's design is user-friendly, allowing audiences to navigate the performance space intuitively while engaging with both live and virtual elements.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The project combined methods from game design and performance arts, creating a blended experience of both worlds" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The fusion of gaming and performance art showcases a successful interdisciplinary collaboration that could inspire further cross-sector innovations in media, tourism, and education.
Global Relevance: As immersive experiences grow globally, this project can influence similar undertakings worldwide, particularly in how digital storytelling and cultural heritage are experienced.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The environment was constantly dynamic, with nature contributing to the changing moods of the performance" (Performance Description, p. 74)​(3).
Example:

Resilience: By incorporating natural elements and flexible design, the project is adaptable to different locations and evolving environmental conditions.
Adaptability: The blending of physical and digital elements allows the project to remain relevant and evolve as new technologies and performance practices emerge.
This assessment demonstrates the project's significant interdisciplinary contributions and its potential to inspire new approaches in cultural performance, media, and tourism.
