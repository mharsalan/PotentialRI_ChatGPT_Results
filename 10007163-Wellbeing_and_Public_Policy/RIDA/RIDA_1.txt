
Based on the content provided from the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact in your text file, here’s a breakdown of the research impact dimensions for the attached study you uploaded.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
The study can have a wide impact across multiple domains:

Academic Domain: It advances knowledge in mental health, social engagement, and community programs targeting older men.
Social Domain: The men’s shed program addresses social isolation, helping older men reconnect with their community, and promoting mental well-being.
Health Domain: The research supports mental health interventions, suggesting the men’s sheds can improve mental health by providing social outlets, particularly for those at risk of loneliness.
Policy Domain: The study could inform public health policy, pushing for the adoption of more community-led health promotion strategies.
Example: This research can directly influence policies around community mental health interventions and encourage broader governmental support for community-based programs like men’s sheds.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: The research can lead to immediate improvements in local community health and social inclusion by encouraging new men’s sheds to be established quickly after publication.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the men’s shed model may influence broader social and health policies related to aging populations, reducing social isolation on a national or even global scale.
Example: In the short term, the research can influence local programs, while in the long term, it could contribute to national health and social care policies on supporting aging populations.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Participants of the men’s shed programs (older men), healthcare professionals, and community workers.
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader society, including families of participants and community groups, as well as future generations of older men who may benefit from these initiatives.
Example: Health professionals and local councils can use the findings to support mental health interventions. Indirect stakeholders, like local communities, benefit from improved social cohesion.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a profound impact on how community mental health interventions are structured, specifically for older men.
Broad Impact: The men’s shed model can be transferred to other vulnerable groups beyond older men, such as younger men or women’s groups, potentially benefiting multiple communities.
Example: The study can deeply impact mental health strategies while also reaching broader communities by offering adaptable models for other at-risk groups.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The men’s shed program can be expanded to different regions or scaled to national levels, helping more communities establish similar programs.
Transferability: The concepts behind the men’s sheds can be transferred to other settings, such as retirement homes or mental health support groups for other demographics.
Example: This research can be scaled up across other regions in the UK or transferred to international contexts where aging populations face similar social isolation issues.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The men’s shed model represents an innovative approach to community mental health, where social interaction and informal spaces help older men build connections.
Disruption: It challenges traditional clinical mental health interventions by providing non-clinical, community-driven solutions to isolation and mental health issues.
Example: This research disrupts the standard approach to mental health care by showing the value of community-based, non-clinical interventions.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The men’s sheds are sustainable as they are cost-effective and can be maintained by local communities with limited resources.
Ethical Considerations: The study addresses ethical issues of social justice by promoting inclusion and support for marginalized older men who might otherwise be neglected.
Example: By ensuring that marginalized groups receive social support, the research promotes long-term social sustainability.

8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study’s findings can be easily implemented through local community efforts or partnerships with public health agencies to establish more men’s sheds.
Usability: Community organizations can adopt the men’s shed model to address mental health and social engagement among other groups, ensuring its wide usability.
Example: The findings are highly usable for both community health organizations and policymakers looking to promote social inclusion and mental well-being.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary: The study integrates elements of mental health, social work, and community development.
Global Relevance: Social isolation among older adults is a global issue, and the research has broad relevance, especially in countries with rapidly aging populations.
Example: The men’s shed concept is relevant across global contexts, where aging populations struggle with similar issues of social isolation and mental health.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The men’s shed model is resilient to changing societal needs as it focuses on flexible, community-based social support.
Adaptability: The model is adaptable to different community settings and cultural contexts, ensuring it remains relevant over time.
Example: As societies continue to age, this research can be adapted to support various demographic shifts, maintaining its relevance in addressing social isolation.

These dimensions provide a comprehensive view of how this research impacts multiple areas, from policy influence to social engagement, ensuring both immediate and long-term benefits for diverse stakeholders.
