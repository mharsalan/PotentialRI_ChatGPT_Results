
The provided document outlines the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, which can be applied to your study as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
This dimension assesses the influence of research across various sectors such as academia, health, policy, and more. Your study can impact the Health Domain by contributing to mental health strategies, the Policy Domain by shaping community health policies, and the Social Domain by reducing social isolation.

Example: The study can improve mental health programs by informing policymakers on the benefits of non-clinical interventions like men's sheds.
2. Duration of Research Impact
The study may have short-term impacts by influencing immediate public health decisions and long-term impacts by becoming foundational research for future community health interventions.

Example: Men’s sheds could be rapidly adopted as a model for addressing social isolation, while the long-term effect could reshape mental health care for older men over the coming years.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Stakeholders include older men, community organizations, public health professionals, and policymakers. Each group benefits directly or indirectly from the findings.

Example: Community groups can implement new strategies to reduce isolation, while policymakers can adapt programs based on the study's findings.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
This study has a deep impact on the field of community-based mental health interventions and a broad impact across various disciplines like psychology, sociology, and public health.

Example: It deeply affects mental health interventions for older men and broadly influences community health and public policy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
The research has the potential to be scaled up from local men’s sheds to national or international programs. It is also transferable to other demographic groups and geographic regions.

Example: Men’s sheds can be adapted to different cultures or expanded to address other issues like unemployment or veterans' care.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study introduces innovative community-based mental health interventions, potentially disrupting traditional clinical approaches.

Example: The men’s shed model could replace clinical interventions for certain populations, offering a low-cost, community-driven alternative.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Men’s sheds are a sustainable model of mental health care that can be maintained by local communities, with strong ethical foundations in promoting dignity and inclusion.

Example: This research promotes sustainability by empowering communities and ensures ethical considerations by supporting older men's mental health in a non-clinical, inclusive way.
8. Implementation and Usability
The findings are immediately usable by public health bodies and community organizations. Men’s sheds can be implemented with minimal infrastructure and tailored to local needs.

Example: Health professionals can quickly apply the study’s recommendations to establish new men’s sheds.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The study is relevant across disciplines like public health, social work, and psychology, and it holds global relevance due to aging populations in many countries.

Example: The findings could influence aging-related health care strategies worldwide, especially in regions with growing elderly populations.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Men’s sheds are resilient because they are adaptable to different social, economic, and cultural contexts. The model can survive in both high and low-resource settings.

Example: The program can be modified to suit different communities, ensuring its sustainability and adaptability in various environments.
These dimensions show the potential breadth and depth of the study's impact, from local community applications to international policy influence.
