
The document titled “Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions” outlines research impact dimensions that are crucial in evaluating how research affects various domains. Here’s a breakdown of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions for the study you provided:

1. Domains of Research Impact
This dimension identifies the various sectors or areas where research exerts influence. The study on men's sheds will have the following domain impacts:

Academic Domain: It contributes to academic discourse in the fields of public health, community-based health interventions, and mental health, providing empirical data on how such programs can improve well-being among men.
Social Domain: By addressing social isolation and mental health among older men, the research has a societal impact, potentially leading to increased adoption of community-based interventions that enhance social cohesion and well-being.
Health Domain: The research findings on men’s sheds contribute to better understanding mental health interventions, specifically non-clinical programs that reduce loneliness and improve psychological well-being.
Example: The study could inform policies for social care and public health programs, promoting more community-based mental health interventions across the UK.

2. Duration of Research Impact
This dimension captures the time frame over which the research influences practice, policy, and further research.

Short-term Impact: In the short term, the study's findings can inform local governments and community organizations about the immediate benefits of men’s sheds for reducing social isolation.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research may serve as a foundational study that influences national mental health strategies and shapes policies on community-based interventions for other at-risk groups beyond men.
Example: In the short term, the study could help establish more men’s sheds, while its long-term impact may influence public health policy and promote community-led mental health initiatives.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
This dimension identifies the individuals, groups, or sectors that benefit from the research.

Direct Stakeholders: Community organizations, local governments, public health professionals, and mental health practitioners are the direct beneficiaries, as they can apply the study’s findings to develop and expand community-based health programs.
Indirect Stakeholders: Families of participants, broader communities, and society at large will benefit indirectly as improved mental health and social integration among men lead to more cohesive communities.
Example: Health authorities and public health officials can use the research to develop local mental health strategies, while community members benefit from increased social engagement among older men.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
This dimension addresses how deeply the research affects its specific field and how broadly it impacts other fields or sectors.

Deep Impact: The study offers in-depth insights into mental health interventions for older men, potentially changing how social programs and public health policies address mental health issues in this population.
Broad Impact: The men’s shed model can be adapted to other groups, such as women, younger men, or different marginalized communities, leading to broad impacts across various societal sectors.
Example: The research could deeply influence community-based mental health strategies while also having broader applications in other demographic groups suffering from social isolation.

5. Scalability and Transferability
This dimension refers to whether the research can be scaled up or transferred to other fields or contexts.

Scalability: The findings of the men’s sheds study can be scaled to other regions, promoting the expansion of such programs across different areas of the UK and beyond.
Transferability: The principles of community engagement and peer support found in the men’s sheds can be transferred to other interventions aimed at different demographic groups or in international contexts.
Example: The model could be scaled to national levels, helping address mental health issues across the country, and transferred to other community-led initiatives targeting different age groups or even other social problems.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
This dimension assesses how innovative or disruptive the research is in its field.

Innovation: The research introduces an innovative non-clinical approach to mental health, emphasizing community-based interventions over traditional clinical methods.
Disruption: It challenges the conventional, clinic-centered approach to mental health, promoting a model where social connection and peer support are primary tools for enhancing mental well-being.
Example: By promoting a shift from clinical to community-based mental health care, the study disrupts traditional health care paradigms and offers new solutions for public health interventions.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
This dimension focuses on the long-term viability of the research findings and any ethical concerns.

Sustainability: The men’s sheds model is inherently sustainable as it is low-cost, community-driven, and based on volunteerism and peer support.
Ethical Considerations: Ethically, the research supports social justice by targeting vulnerable, often marginalized groups, providing them with access to mental health resources in a non-clinical, non-stigmatizing setting.
Example: The program’s sustainability is enhanced by its low-resource nature, making it a viable long-term solution for social and mental health challenges in underserved populations.

8. Implementation and Usability
This dimension evaluates how easily the research findings can be implemented in practice.

Implementation: The research findings can be applied almost immediately by community organizations and local authorities, offering clear guidance on how to establish and run men’s sheds.
Usability: The study offers practical recommendations that are directly applicable to community health workers, policymakers, and social service providers.
Example: Health authorities can quickly implement men’s shed programs by following the study’s recommendations, leading to practical changes in community-based health interventions.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
This dimension looks at whether the research impacts multiple disciplines and has global implications.

Cross-disciplinary: The research intersects several disciplines, including public health, psychology, community development, and social policy.
Global Relevance: The problem of social isolation among older adults is not unique to the UK, making the findings relevant in international settings, particularly in countries with aging populations.
Example: The men’s shed model can be adapted globally to address social isolation and mental health issues among aging populations, making the study relevant to countries worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
This dimension assesses how adaptable the research findings are to different contexts and how resilient they are to changing societal needs.

Resilience: The men’s shed model is resilient as it is based on community involvement and peer support, making it flexible enough to adapt to different societal needs and challenges.
Adaptability: The program can easily be adapted to different community settings, demographic groups, and cultural contexts, ensuring its long-term relevance.
Example: The flexibility of the men’s shed model makes it adaptable to changing social and health needs, ensuring its continued relevance in addressing mental health and social isolation.

These dimensions provide a comprehensive analysis of how the study will influence various areas and stakeholders, ensuring both immediate and long-term impacts across diverse sectors such as public health, policy, and community development.
