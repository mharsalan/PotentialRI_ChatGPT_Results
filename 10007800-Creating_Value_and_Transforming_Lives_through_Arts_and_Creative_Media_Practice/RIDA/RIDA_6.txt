Here are the research impact dimensions based on the detailed analysis of the provided study:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The research addresses multiple domains such as the social, environmental, and policy sectors by promoting the revaluation of waste workers in urban settings and their contribution to sustainable urbanization.
"The project explores how waste can be repurposed, revalued, and reimagined to create new products, businesses, and livelihoods now and in the cities of the future." - Context​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
"Changing public perceptions of waste, encouraging wider publics to rethink and re-evaluate their attitudes to waste and disposability in its many forms" - Context​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
Page Reference: Context (Various Outputs)
Example: The study influences social and environmental policies by promoting the circular economy and sustainability initiatives. The involvement of informal waste workers highlights social impact, while the repurposing of waste addresses environmental concerns.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts: The impact is both short-term (through immediate public awareness campaigns and policy influence) and long-term (through foundational work on sustainability and urban development).
"This work is feeding into a major new research project funded by the UK's Global Challenges Research Fund... examining lessons from the interface of formal/informal urban systems." - Context​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
Page Reference: Contribution to the Field
Example: In the short term, the project changes public and policy perspectives on waste work, while long-term impacts involve systemic policy shifts on urban sustainability and the role of informal sectors.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpts: The research impacts various stakeholders, including local communities in Dharavi, policymakers, urban planners, and international organizations working on sustainable development and informal economy research.
"The project influences policy thinking around the value of the informal circular economy... importance of investment in learning/development for most deprived citizens." - Dissemination​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
Page Reference: Dissemination
Example: Local waste workers benefit directly, while policymakers and global researchers gain new insights into informal economies, urban planning, and sustainability initiatives.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: The research demonstrates deep impact within urban studies and environmental sustainability, but its breadth spans policy, art, and social sciences.
"This interdisciplinary project integrates social scientists, engineers, artists, and environmental scientists." - Contribution to the Field​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
Page Reference: Contribution to the Field
Example: Deep impact occurs through changing perceptions of waste work and environmental justice, while the broad impact is seen in influencing cross-disciplinary fields like urban policy and sustainability.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: The project has strong potential for scalability (influencing urban planning and sustainability in other cities globally) and transferability (adapting the circular economy model to other sectors).
"A technology assessment platform jointly developed... allows residents to voice perspectives on the impact of digital technologies on their work and lives." - Contribution to the Field​(Knowledge - Potential R…)
Page Reference: Dissemination
Example: The model of integrating informal workers into circular economy systems can be scaled to other developing urban centers, while the technological tools can be transferred to other industries or sectors.
These dimensions encapsulate the diverse and profound impact the research study brings across different domains and time frames, involving multiple stakeholders.

Here are the remaining five research impact dimensions derived from the provided document:

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: The project fosters innovation by using new artistic and technological tools, such as 3D scanning and plastic remanufacturing, disrupting traditional waste management and recycling approaches.
"Dawson's residency deployed 3D scanning technologies to make portraits with individual participants, which were then printed in plastic, alongside extensive mapping and modeling." - Dissemination​(6)
Page Reference: Dissemination, Chapter 9​(6)
Example: The innovative use of digital tools and artistic interventions in waste management, particularly with marginalized communities, introduces new methods that disrupt conventional waste management and promote circular economy practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: The study promotes sustainability by reimagining waste and improving livelihoods in marginalized communities through ethical urbanization practices.
"Our work enables and encourages wider publics to rethink and re-evaluate their attitudes to waste and disposability in its many forms." - Context​(6)
Page Reference: Context
Example: By focusing on informal waste workers and their essential contributions to urban sustainability, the project addresses both environmental sustainability and social justice.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: The research findings have strong usability, particularly in urban planning and policy-making. The partnership with the Maharashtra Government and other organizations shows its practical application.
"The learning from the project is being shared with key industry and policy partners in India... influencing policy thinking around the value of the informal circular economy." - Dissemination​(6)
Page Reference: Dissemination​(6)
Example: The research is directly usable by policymakers, city planners, and organizations focused on urban informality, waste management, and sustainability.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: The project integrates interdisciplinary research, including social sciences, engineering, and environmental studies, while addressing global challenges like waste management in cities.
"An interdisciplinary team of social scientists, engineers, artists, and environmental scientists are in dialogue with communities in Dharavi." - Dissemination​(6)
Page Reference: Dissemination​(6)
Example: The research crosses multiple disciplines and has global relevance in urban sustainability, particularly in cities with significant informal economies like Dharavi.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: The research shows resilience by adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic with virtual training and ongoing community engagement.
"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the research team developed a virtual training and mentoring programme in documentary filmmaking." - Dissemination​(6)
Page Reference: Dissemination​(6)
Example: The project's adaptability during the pandemic exemplifies how research can continue to impact communities despite changing external circumstances, ensuring long-term relevance.
These dimensions highlight the research's contributions to interdisciplinary collaboration, sustainability, and its practical application in real-world settings.
