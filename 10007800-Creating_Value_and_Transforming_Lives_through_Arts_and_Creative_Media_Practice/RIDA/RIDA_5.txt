Based on the research study you provided, here is a detailed analysis of its research impact across the top 10 dimensions, with specific excerpts and examples:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study spans multiple domains such as criminal justice, community re-integration, and creative arts. Specifically, it highlights "the role and effectiveness of songwriting practices in criminal justice" and aims to create societal change through reintegration after punishment (p. 18).
Example: The research has social impact by engaging with both incarcerated individuals and civil society to foster reintegration, while also contributing to criminology and the arts by using songwriting as a means of social healing.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The project is part of a larger, long-term effort funded by ESRC and AHRC, involving iterative creative practices over 3 years. "The long-term impact of this project is in changing how re-integration post-incarceration is perceived and supported" (p. 17).
Example: The project's impact will extend beyond its duration by influencing policy changes and improving community engagement practices in criminal justice reform.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders include "current and former prisoners, victims of crime, prison officers, social workers, and third sector organizations" (p. 15).
Example: Direct stakeholders like criminal justice workers and prisoners benefit immediately from the community-building outcomes, while the public and policy-makers benefit indirectly from enhanced reintegration strategies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The research has deep impact on the field of criminal justice by providing innovative, arts-based methodologies for reintegration, and broad impact by influencing community-based practices across Scotland (p. 18).
Example: The research's depth is shown in its detailed exploration of reintegration practices, while its breadth spans various sectors, including social work, criminal justice, and the arts.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The methodologies developed in the project, such as the 'TREES' and 'Pebbles' techniques, have the potential to be "scaled beyond the immediate context of criminal justice and applied in other social change environments" (p. 17).
Example: The collaborative songwriting approach could be adapted to other marginalized communities beyond criminal justice, making it transferable to different cultural contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The project introduces disruptive innovation in criminology by using creative arts to explore reintegration, challenging traditional punitive measures. "Songs as both a means of and catalyst for communication have broken down disciplinary borders" (p. 18).
Example: The integration of arts and criminal justice disrupts conventional methods by using songwriting to foster reconciliation and reduce re-offense rates.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research contributes to social sustainability by addressing the long-term reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals. It is also ethically grounded in participatory practices involving affected communities (p. 17).
Example: The project promotes social justice by ensuring that the voices of marginalized groups are heard and integrated into reintegration strategies, thus fostering ethical and sustainable social outcomes.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research "can be implemented by community justice systems, third-sector organizations, and governmental bodies" to enhance reintegration policies (p. 16).
Example: The practical application of songwriting workshops makes it highly usable for criminal justice systems looking to improve their rehabilitative practices.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research is cross-disciplinary, merging criminology, social work, and the arts, and has global relevance as other justice systems worldwide could adopt similar methods to support reintegration (p. 18).
Example: The intersection of art, criminal justice, and community engagement offers a model that can be replicated in various international contexts, particularly in areas focusing on restorative justice.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The project's methodology shows resilience by being adaptable to different types of reintegration scenarios, whether in closed prison settings or community environments (p. 17).
Example: The iterative nature of the research allows for continued adaptation as it moves from practice-based outputs to influencing broader criminal justice policies over time.
This comprehensive breakdown highlights the research's multifaceted impact across different domains, stakeholders, and applications, emphasizing its long-term contributions and broad applicability.
