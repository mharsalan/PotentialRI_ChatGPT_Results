Based on the provided study and using the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is a detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The project has a significant social impact by engaging communities in creative processes such as performance, visual arts, and media to address issues, solve problems, and generate alternative futures. It involves community arts groups working with marginalized people to enable social inclusion and active participation in society. ("Remaking Society" – Executive Summary, p. 2)

Page Reference and Section: Executive Summary, p. 2

Example: The research impacts the Social Domain by fostering inclusive communities through cultural production, addressing social exclusion, and enhancing local wellbeing. It also contributes to the Cultural and Artistic Domain, as it explores how creative engagement can help re-imagine society.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The project involves long-term commitments to community arts practices that span over a decade, showing sustained efforts in building relationships within communities through artistic and media practices. ("Remaking Society" – Background, p. 6)

Page Reference and Section: Background, p. 6

Example: The research likely has Long-term Impact due to its sustained focus on community engagement over many years, fostering deep-rooted social transformation and cultural practices that resist government and market logics.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The stakeholders include community arts organizations like Bradford Community Broadcasting and Theatre Modo, who work with marginalized populations in deprived areas. These organizations represent and directly impact local communities by facilitating their engagement in cultural production. ("Remaking Society" – Remaking Community, p. 6)

Page Reference and Section: Remaking Community, p. 6

Example: The Direct Stakeholders are community members in economically deprived areas, while Indirect Stakeholders include local governments, as the outcomes of this engagement can influence social policies and community development practices.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The project contributes deeply to the social fabric of the communities involved by engaging with marginalized groups and encouraging cultural production. It also has broad applications across different sectors, such as social welfare, community development, and participatory democracy. ("Remaking Society" – Community arts practices as re-makers of society, p. 7)

Page Reference and Section: Community arts practices as re-makers of society, p. 7

Example: The research has a Deep Impact within the specific communities by transforming their social engagement and creative capacities. Its Broad Impact reaches across cultural and social domains, influencing the way community development is approached in broader contexts.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The project showcases how arts practices in small communities can be scaled to other regions, promoting social inclusion and civic engagement in diverse contexts. ("Remaking Society" – Remaking Community, p. 6)

Page Reference and Section: Remaking Community, p. 6

Example: The research is Scalable as its principles of using arts for social inclusion can be applied to similar deprived communities globally. It is also Transferable, as its methods (like community engagement through media and performance) can be adapted to other marginalized groups or different cultural contexts.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The project’s use of arts and cultural production challenges traditional models of social work and regeneration by positioning communities as active creators rather than passive recipients of welfare. ("Remaking Society" – Background, p. 4)

Page Reference and Section: Background, p. 4

Example: The research has Disruption Potential as it redefines the role of community engagement in addressing social issues, moving away from deficit-based models to empowering community-led cultural production. This approach disrupts conventional practices in social work and regeneration.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The project emphasizes long-term sustainability through its commitment to empowering communities, ensuring that their practices and cultural outputs are not commodified or reduced to government-led outcomes. ("Remaking Society" – Subversive Truths, p. 9)

Page Reference and Section: Subversive Truths, p. 9

Example: The research contributes to Sustainability by fostering cultural vitality and social inclusion, which promote the wellbeing of communities over time. It also adheres to Ethical Considerations by ensuring that communities retain autonomy in defining their cultural practices, avoiding the exploitation of marginalized groups.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research is highly usable as it provides a practical model for engaging communities in dynamic, creative processes that can be implemented in various social contexts. ("Remaking Society" – Remaking Community, p. 7)

Page Reference and Section: Remaking Community, p. 7

Example: The project is easily implementable in other communities facing social exclusion, as it offers a clear framework for using arts and media to engage marginalized populations in self-expression and community building.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The project draws on diverse disciplines, including social sciences, cultural studies, and performance arts, creating cross-disciplinary insights into community development. ("Remaking Society" – Background, p. 5)

Page Reference and Section: Background, p. 5

Example: The research has Global Relevance as its principles of community engagement and cultural production can be applied in various cultural and political contexts worldwide, especially in regions where social inclusion is a challenge.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The organizations involved in the project have been resilient in adapting to changes in funding and political contexts, ensuring that they continue to support community engagement despite external challenges. ("Remaking Society" – Community arts practices as re-makers of society, p. 7)

Page Reference and Section: Community arts practices as re-makers of society, p. 7

Example: The research demonstrates Resilience by maintaining long-term community engagement despite fluctuations in external support, and it is Adaptable as its models can be modified to suit different community needs and political contexts.
