Here is the detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the provided study, based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study focuses on urban regeneration and cultural heritage preservation, especially in the context of Gdansk Shipyard. It explores the role of the artists’ collective in engaging local citizens and transforming the public’s perception of industrial heritage and urban regeneration planning. (Introduction, page 116; Methods, pages 116–117).
Page Reference: 116–117, 120.
Example: The research impacts the cultural domain by preserving the shipyard’s identity and industrial heritage through art. It also affects the social domain by involving citizens in the urban regeneration process, empowering local communities.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study spans a decade (2000–2010), showing both short-term impacts, such as immediate public engagement in cultural projects, and long-term impacts, including sustained efforts to protect the shipyard’s heritage and influence urban policy. (Results, pages 116–117).
Page Reference: 116–117.
Example: The long-term impact is evident in the shift in public perception of Gdansk’s industrial heritage, leading to ongoing preservation efforts and continued dialogues about urban planning strategies.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: The direct stakeholders include the artists, urban planners, and local government, while indirect stakeholders involve the broader community and future generations who benefit from the preservation of Gdansk’s cultural heritage. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: The direct stakeholders are the artists who lead the participatory projects, and the indirect stakeholders include Gdansk citizens and future generations who will inherit a preserved cultural site.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research has a deep impact on cultural heritage preservation and urban planning, particularly in the context of Gdansk Shipyard. It also has broad interdisciplinary relevance, touching on art, urban studies, and public policy. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: Deep impact is seen in the artists’ influence on local heritage preservation, while the broad impact crosses over into urban planning, involving multiple disciplines.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The study’s methodologies, such as participatory arts-led regeneration, can be transferred to other urban settings facing similar challenges of heritage preservation. (Discussion, page 118).
Page Reference: 118.
Example: The participatory approach in this study can be transferred to other post-industrial cities seeking to balance heritage preservation with urban development.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The study introduces innovative practices by integrating art and urban regeneration, challenging traditional top-down approaches to city planning and offering a more participatory, bottom-up method. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: The disruptive potential lies in challenging the traditional expert-led urban planning methods, introducing a participatory, community-driven process.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research addresses the sustainability of cultural heritage by advocating for the long-term preservation of the Gdansk Shipyard. Ethical considerations include the responsibility to future generations in maintaining this industrial heritage. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: The study emphasizes sustainability by promoting the preservation of the shipyard’s cultural heritage, ensuring that future generations can engage with the historical site.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research findings are highly usable in urban planning, particularly in post-industrial contexts. The methods used by the artists can be implemented in other cities to enhance citizen engagement in heritage preservation. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: The participatory approach used by the artists can be readily implemented in other urban contexts to engage citizens in regeneration processes.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research is cross-disciplinary, involving urban planning, cultural studies, and the arts. Its relevance is global, as many post-industrial cities face similar challenges of balancing heritage preservation with development. (Introduction, page 116).
Page Reference: 116.
Example: The study’s findings are globally relevant, especially for cities around the world that are undergoing similar transitions from industrial to post-industrial economies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The research demonstrates adaptability by responding to the changing needs of Gdansk’s urban landscape and adjusting its strategies for heritage preservation as new challenges emerge. (Discussion, page 125).
Page Reference: 125.
Example: The artists’ methods show resilience in preserving heritage despite pressures from developers and local government decisions that may not prioritize cultural preservation.
