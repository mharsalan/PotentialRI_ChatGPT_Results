Based on the research paper you uploaded and the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" provided in your file, I have outlined the detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions of the study titled "Do music festival communities address environmental sustainability and how? A Scottish case study". Below is the analysis:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "This article discusses the findings of an Arts and Humanities Research Council project researching how music festival communities in Scotland can address issues of environmental sustainability and climate change." (Abstract, p.2)
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, p.2.
Example: This study primarily impacts the Environmental domain by addressing sustainability issues in festival culture. It also has implications for the Social domain, as it involves the behaviors and attitudes of festival-goers and organizers toward climate change. The Cultural domain is impacted as festivals are part of Scotland's musical and cultural landscape.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Our research project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council examines what role, if any, music festival communities might play in addressing the contemporary challenge of environmental sustainability." (Introduction, p.3)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, p.3.
Example: The study has long-term impact potential by contributing foundational knowledge for future research on sustainable event management and influencing how festivals operate regarding sustainability over time. Short-term impacts may arise from immediate practical changes in how festivals manage travel emissions and waste.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: "We employed a variety of research methods to interrogate different constituents in music festival communities about their views and behaviors regarding climate change and environmental sustainability." (Abstract, p.2)
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, p.2.
Example: Direct stakeholders include festival organizers, musicians, and policymakers, who can use the research findings to make festivals more sustainable. Indirect stakeholders are the festival audiences and the wider community who benefit from reduced environmental harm and increased awareness.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Festivals derive cultural cachet from their historic association with environmental utopianism... but more often festival sites vividly dramatize the difficulty of living sustainably." (Introduction, p.4)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, p.4.
Example: The deep impact of this research is on the environmental practices within festival management, while the breadth spans across social and cultural fields by influencing both event management and audience behaviors.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "We employed a mixed methods approach...to engage with the different communities identified." (Methods, p.11)
Page Reference and Section: Methods, p.11.
Example: The scalability of this research could extend to festivals across Scotland and other countries, and the transferability allows its findings to be applied to other event types like conferences or fairs seeking to implement sustainable practices.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "Rather than being a site for progressive or utopian socio-cultural experimentation... music festival communities engage in complex and often contradictory behaviors regarding sustainability." (Abstract, p.2)
Page Reference and Section: Abstract, p.2.
Example: The research has disruptive potential in challenging the romanticized view of music festivals as environmentally progressive and urging organizers to implement more realistic, actionable sustainability practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The constraints...logistically and financially... are simply not workable." (Introduction, p.10)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, p.10.
Example: The study addresses sustainability by highlighting the environmental challenges festivals face, particularly in travel and waste management, and calls for more ethical practices in festival organization to reduce their carbon footprints.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Waste produced during festival events received a disproportionate amount of attention... despite its relatively low environmental impact." (Festival Organizers, p.14)
Page Reference and Section: Festival Organizers, p.14.
Example: The usability of the research findings lies in practical suggestions for festival organizers on reducing waste, managing energy, and promoting sustainable audience behaviors, which can be directly implemented in future events.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "We wanted to focus on the three stakeholder groups who are generally physically at a music festival... audience, artist, and promoter." (Methods, p.10)
Page Reference and Section: Methods, p.10.
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by involving environmental science, music studies, sociology, and event management. Its global relevance stems from addressing the universal challenge of sustainability in live events, which can apply to festivals globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "Music festivals...face an uphill battle as they try to square their own environmental legacy while reinventing themselves for later generations." (Introduction, p.4)
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, p.4.
Example: The research highlights the need for resilience in festival communities to adapt to the growing pressure of climate change and regulatory demands, offering strategies that can help festivals evolve to meet future sustainability challenges.
This detailed breakdown aligns with the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" and showcases how the study influences various aspects of environmental sustainability in music festivals.
