Here is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the study "Precarious Spaces: The Arts, Social and Organizational Change," based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study emphasizes various domains, including social, cultural, and policy impacts. It explores "socially and community-engaged art practices" in urban spaces, such as favelas and other informal communities, and how art-based interventions can lead to "social and transformative consequences" (Chapter 1, Page 6).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Pages 3-7.
Example: The research informs the cultural domain by documenting the preservation and transformation of marginalized spaces through art and activism, impacting both the artistic practices and social policies in urban planning.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study contributes to long-term socio-political discourse on the "precarity of living" in marginalized spaces and the role of arts in fostering sustainable, community-driven solutions (Chapter 1, Page 5). It also introduces new frameworks for understanding autonomy and agency, which have lasting theoretical implications (Chapter 2, Page 18).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Pages 3-7; Chapter 2, Pages 17-18.
Example: Long-term Impact—The study’s findings on the use of art in precarious spaces will likely shape future urban development policies and socio-cultural practices in both the Global South and North.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The direct stakeholders are artists, urban planners, and community organizers who engage in "participatory arts-based interventions" (Chapter 3, Page 61). Indirect stakeholders include marginalized communities who benefit from these art interventions, such as favela residents (Chapter 3, Page 37).
Page Reference: Chapter 3, Pages 37-61.
Example: Artists and community leaders are direct stakeholders as they use the study’s findings to implement arts-based interventions, while residents of favelas and similar communities are indirect stakeholders, benefiting from improved living conditions and social cohesion.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study has deep impact in the field of art and social sciences by transforming how precarious urban spaces are conceptualized and engaged with through artistic practices (Chapter 1, Page 7). It also has broad impact across disciplines like urban studies, sociology, and organizational change.
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Pages 7-11.
Example: The research creates a deep impact on understanding urban marginalization and a broad impact by influencing multiple fields, including geography, sociology, and political theory.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study discusses methodologies that are "transferable" from the Global South to the Global North, particularly in addressing socio-economic challenges and urban voids through arts-based practices (Chapter 1, Page 8).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Page 8.
Example: The methods applied in Brazilian favelas can be scaled to similar informal settlements globally, offering transferable solutions for urban precariousness through art-driven community engagement.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The study introduces innovative frameworks by using art to address precarious spaces, challenging conventional urban planning and social organization strategies (Chapter 1, Page 10). The notion of "OrgansparkZ" as spontaneous art activism is particularly disruptive (Chapter 7, Page 131).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Page 10; Chapter 7, Page 131.
Example: The concept of "OrgansparkZ" as a form of art-driven social activism can disrupt traditional models of community organization by creating more fluid, grassroots-driven spaces for social change.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research promotes ethical engagement with marginalized communities, emphasizing sustainable, community-led transformations rather than top-down interventions (Chapter 3, Pages 61-87).
Page Reference: Chapter 3, Pages 61-87.
Example: The participatory nature of the art interventions ensures ethical engagement with communities, prioritizing their needs and fostering sustainable socio-cultural change.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study’s findings are highly usable for practitioners in urban development, community organization, and social change activism. The detailed case studies provide practical frameworks for implementation (Chapter 2, Page 17).
Page Reference: Chapter 2, Pages 17-19.
Example: Urban planners and community leaders can implement these findings to develop more inclusive, arts-based strategies for addressing the challenges of urban informality.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The research bridges disciplines such as art, sociology, urban studies, and political theory, making it relevant across multiple academic and practical domains (Chapter 1, Page 8). It also addresses global issues of precarity, applicable to both the Global North and South (Chapter 2, Page 20).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Pages 8-9; Chapter 2, Pages 19-20.
Example: The study has global relevance, providing insights that can be applied in addressing urban precarity in cities around the world, from Rio de Janeiro to London.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study focuses on the adaptability of marginalized communities, highlighting how they "rag-pick and recycle" societal leftovers to create sustainable living conditions (Chapter 1, Page 5). It emphasizes resilience in the face of economic and social instability (Chapter 1, Page 7).
Page Reference: Chapter 1, Pages 5-7.
Example: The research highlights the resilience of favela communities, offering adaptable solutions that can be applied in other informal urban settings to foster sustainable, self-organized communities.
This assessment offers a comprehensive view of how the study "Precarious Spaces" impacts multiple research dimensions, making it a critical resource for academics, urban planners, and community organizers interested in the intersection of art, social change, and precarious urban spaces.
