Based on my analysis of the study and alignment with various research impact frameworks from the provided documents, here is a detailed categorization of the potential research impacts, organized by their types:

1. Cultural and Social Impact
Cultural Heritage Preservation: The study's emphasis on the preservation of Gdansk Shipyard through participatory urban regeneration enhances cultural heritage. It contributes to preserving industrial and maritime history while fostering cultural identity and pride among local communities​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
Community Engagement and Empowerment: The study's participatory approach in engaging local citizens through art-driven urban regeneration has empowered communities. By involving artists and citizens in planning, it has fostered social cohesion and strengthened the public's role in decision-making​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Behavioral Change: The participatory processes that engaged citizens in heritage protection could lead to shifts in public perceptions and behavior towards preserving other historical sites and urban spaces​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
2. Academic and Knowledge Impact
Contribution to Urban Studies and Cultural Heritage Disciplines: The study contributes to the academic discourse on urban regeneration, participatory planning, and cultural heritage management. It expands theoretical frameworks on how art can be used to preserve industrial heritage and influence urban development strategies​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cross-disciplinary Knowledge: It bridges urban planning, cultural studies, and art, offering insights into how cross-disciplinary collaboration can be leveraged to address complex urban challenges. This approach can be adapted and researched further in urban planning, sociology, and arts fields​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy and Public Governance Impact
Influence on Urban Planning Policy: The study may impact local and regional policies concerning heritage protection and urban regeneration by demonstrating the value of participatory approaches in city planning. Policymakers could adopt this method to involve communities more actively in development projects​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Policy Advocacy for Cultural Heritage: Through the project's results, it could influence policy discussions at the national level, advocating for more resources and support for preserving industrial heritage sites. This could inform cultural preservation laws and funding models​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
4. Economic and Tourism Impact
Boost to Local Economy through Cultural Tourism: The preservation of the Gdansk Shipyard and its integration into cultural tourism circuits could lead to increased economic activity by attracting tourists, further supported by the artistic interventions in the space​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Long-term Economic Impact of Revitalization: Urban regeneration can stimulate local economies, create jobs, and improve infrastructure, which could attract more businesses and visitors, ensuring a sustainable flow of economic benefits over time​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainable Urban Development: By advocating for the preservation of industrial heritage sites, the study promotes the sustainable reuse of existing structures rather than demolishing them. This reduces environmental degradation associated with new construction and aligns with sustainable urban development goals​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Urban Resilience and Adaptability: The study's methods demonstrate the potential of integrating cultural heritage into urban resilience strategies. It provides an adaptable framework for cities facing the challenge of balancing heritage preservation with modernization​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Implementation and Usability Impact
Scalability of Participatory Models: The participatory models used in this research can be adapted and implemented in other post-industrial cities facing similar challenges. This flexibility makes the findings highly usable in urban contexts worldwide​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Transferability to Global Contexts: The approach has broad transferability, as other cities globally dealing with industrial decline and heritage preservation can adapt the methods used in the study. This offers a replicable framework for addressing similar urban challenges​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
7. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovative Use of Art in Urban Planning: The use of art as a tool for urban regeneration and heritage preservation represents an innovative disruption in how cities plan and involve communities. This method challenges traditional urban planning processes, offering a more inclusive, creative approach​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruptive Impact on Governance Models: By fostering collaboration between artists, policymakers, and citizens, the study disrupts traditional governance models, demonstrating the potential of community-driven approaches to influence public policy​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Health and Well-being Impact
Improved Well-being through Community Participation: The engagement of citizens in the cultural and urban renewal process could lead to enhanced mental well-being by fostering a sense of belonging and community ownership, contributing to improved quality of life​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Technological and Methodological Advancement
Innovative Methodologies for Urban Regeneration: The participatory and art-led methodologies developed in this study provide a new approach to urban regeneration, focusing on the emotional and cultural connection between people and their environments, which can inspire new technological applications in urban planning​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Equity and Inclusivity Impact
Inclusivity in Urban Regeneration: The study highlights how marginalized communities, including residents historically excluded from urban planning decisions, can be brought into the decision-making process. This promotes more equitable urban regeneration that reflects diverse community needs​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
In summary, this study has the potential for significant multi-dimensional impacts across cultural, social, policy, economic, environmental, and academic domains. It serves as a model for how cultural heritage can be preserved through innovative, inclusive, and scalable approaches​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
