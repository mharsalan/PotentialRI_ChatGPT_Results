Here is an organized list of potential research impacts based on different types, aligned with the study "Precarious Spaces: The Arts, Social and Organizational Change." These impacts are derived from various dimensions of research impact and potential pathways outlined in the texts provided:

1. Social and Cultural Impact
Community Empowerment: The study emphasizes the role of socially engaged art practices in marginalized communities (favelas, urban voids). This can empower local communities, fostering a sense of agency and helping them transform their living spaces through participatory arts (Chapter 1, Page 3)​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cultural Preservation and Enhancement: By documenting and transforming precarious urban spaces through art, the research contributes to cultural preservation. The unique cultural heritage and artistic practices of these marginalized communities are acknowledged and safeguarded through artistic interventions​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Behavioral and Social Change: The study explores how art-driven interventions lead to significant behavioral changes in communities, influencing how residents view their environment and interact with it. This can lead to positive social outcomes, such as greater community cohesion and improved living conditions​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Urban Policy: The research provides insights into how marginalized spaces can be reclaimed through art, which could influence urban policy and planning. Governments and urban planners could adopt more inclusive, community-led approaches in redeveloping informal or precarious settlements​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Advocacy for Marginalized Communities: The study's documentation of favelas and other precarious spaces can be used to advocate for these communities at the policy level, potentially leading to new or modified policies focused on improving the quality of life in informal settlements​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Economic Impact
Job Creation through Arts and Social Enterprises: The participatory art practices documented in the study can foster local economic growth by creating opportunities for artists, craftsmen, and other community members to engage in arts-based social enterprises​(impact pathway).
Economic Sustainability in Urban Development: The focus on sustainable, community-driven transformations offers models that can be scaled and transferred to other informal settlements, fostering economic growth in underprivileged areas through sustainable urban development projects​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Educational Impact
Educational Tool for Urban Studies: The frameworks and methodologies presented in the study offer new educational tools and case studies for students and professionals in urban planning, sociology, and community development programs​(impact pathway).
Capacity Building in Marginalized Communities: The research contributes to capacity building within communities by involving local residents in artistic and organizational efforts to improve their environments. This enhances their skills and knowledge, empowering them to lead future initiatives independently​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Environmental Impact
Sustainable Urban Practices: The study’s exploration of transforming precarious spaces into vibrant urban areas through arts-based practices promotes environmental sustainability. It highlights how communities can reuse and recycle materials, contributing to eco-friendly urban development​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
Resilience to Urbanization Pressures: The findings demonstrate how art interventions in precarious spaces can contribute to environmental resilience by making informal settlements more livable, sustainable, and adaptable to urbanization pressures​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Health and Well-being Impact
Improved Community Well-being: By transforming marginalized spaces into areas of cultural and social engagement, the study’s art-driven interventions can improve mental health and well-being among residents. These transformations help alleviate the psychological and emotional stress associated with living in precarious conditions​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Public Health Advocacy: The research provides a framework that can be used in advocating for improved public health policies, particularly in underdeveloped urban areas where art practices can be integrated into public health strategies​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
7. Technological and Innovation Impact
Innovative Urban Solutions: The study introduces innovative approaches to urban transformation through art. Concepts like “OrgansparkZ” (Chapter 7) are creative responses to urban challenges, offering novel ways to address urban voids and precarious spaces​(Common Research Impact …).
Scalability of Interventions: The art-based interventions discussed in the study can be scaled to other global contexts. This scalability of solutions offers opportunities for innovation in the field of urban planning and social change​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Application of Findings: The methodologies and case studies presented in the research are applicable in both the Global South and the Global North. This cross-disciplinary relevance spans sociology, urban studies, political theory, and the arts, making the findings globally significant​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
International Collaboration Opportunities: The study opens opportunities for international collaboration between artists, urban planners, and policymakers in addressing global challenges like urban precariousness and informal settlements​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
9. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Ethical Engagement with Marginalized Communities: The study emphasizes the importance of ethical, sustainable engagement with marginalized communities through participatory art practices. It advocates for community-led transformations, ensuring ethical considerations are central to urban interventions​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-term Sustainability of Social Practices: The study’s focus on community-driven solutions highlights long-term sustainability in transforming marginalized spaces, ensuring that the improvements last beyond the initial art interventions​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Knowledge Dissemination and Public Awareness
Raising Awareness of Marginalized Urban Spaces: By documenting the transformation of precarious spaces through art, the study raises public awareness about the living conditions in informal settlements. It fosters greater understanding and support for these communities globally​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
Public Engagement through Arts: The participatory nature of the study promotes public engagement, drawing attention to the social issues faced by marginalized communities through art exhibitions, performances, and other public events​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
This comprehensive analysis shows the wide-ranging potential impacts of the study "Precarious Spaces" across various sectors, addressing societal, cultural, economic, environmental, and policy-related challenges through innovative, community-driven art practices.
