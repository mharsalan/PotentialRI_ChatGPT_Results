Regulatory Framework: As more data emerges on the safety and efficacy of secukinumab, it could prompt regulatory changes in the approval processes for biologics, particularly in the management of autoimmune diseases​(impact pathway).
6. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The treatment protocol for secukinumab can be scaled to broader populations, beyond the initial clinical trials, potentially becoming a standard treatment across different healthcare systems globally​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Transferability to Other Autoimmune Conditions: The research could be transferred to other autoimmune diseases where interleukin-17A plays a role, such as ankylosing spondylitis, expanding the therapeutic use of secukinumab​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Ethical Considerations in Long-Term Use: The study addresses long-term safety and adverse effects of biologics, contributing to the sustainability of biologic therapies in clinical use. Ethical implications regarding long-term patient care and drug safety are also considered​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Example: "Further studies are required to assess uncommon serious adverse events associated with long-term use."
8. Social and Cultural Impact
Social Awareness: By raising awareness of psoriatic arthritis and its management, the study could influence public perception and understanding of autoimmune diseases, reducing stigma and encouraging patients to seek effective treatments​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Patient Empowerment: As a result of more accessible and effective treatments, patients may experience increased empowerment and better disease management, leading to improved societal outcomes in terms of quality of life and healthcare engagement​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Risk Reduction and Safety Improvement
Improved Patient Safety: The focus on assessing adverse effects and ensuring the safety of long-term use of secukinumab contributes to improving patient safety protocols in the administration of biologic therapies​(Research impact toolkit).
Example: "Longer and larger studies will be required to assess uncommon serious adverse effects and adverse effects associated with long-term use of secukinumab."
10. Cultural Preservation and Heritage
Cultural Impact through Public Health: If broadly adopted, the treatment could have an impact on reducing healthcare disparities, particularly in regions with limited access to advanced biologics, by potentially democratizing access to innovative therapies​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts, across academic, societal, economic, and health domains, position the study as highly influential in multiple areas related to health care, scientific advancement, and economic growth​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
