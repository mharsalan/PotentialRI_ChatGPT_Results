Based on the detailed analysis of the provided document, the following impacts for the research on "Secukinumab versus Adalimumab for treatment of active Psoriatic Arthritis (EXCEED)" are assessed across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: "This trial addresses an important gap in knowledge that informs the initiation of biological treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis in the context of biological monotherapy." - Results, page 1504.
Example: The study impacts the health domain by contributing valuable data on treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, aiding healthcare professionals and influencing treatment guidelines. It also crosses into the policy domain, guiding clinical decision-making for future biological treatments.
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Page 1504​(8)
2. Duration of RI
Excerpts: "Secukinumab was associated with a higher treatment retention rate than was adalimumab and provided numerically higher clinical responses across musculoskeletal endpoints, skin endpoints, and composite indices at week 52."
Example: This research has a short-term impact by providing immediate insights for clinicians managing psoriatic arthritis, and long-term impact by shaping future studies and treatments targeting musculoskeletal and skin responses to biological treatments.
