Based on the thorough reading of the research study "Ideal Homes, 1918-1939" and the insights from the files provided regarding potential research impacts, here is a detailed assessment of the potential research impacts of this study:

1. Academic Impact:
Depth of Contribution: This study contributes significantly to the academic fields of architecture, cultural history, and social geography by offering a nuanced analysis of suburban modernism, especially the role of consumer agency in shaping domestic spaces. It challenges the prevailing architectural narratives dominated by Modernism, offering an alternative historical framework that considers the Tudorbethan style and other suburban aesthetics.
Interdisciplinary Reach: The study crosses into gender studies, as it discusses the domestic roles of women in suburban homes, and urban studies, given its focus on the spatial development of suburbs.
Examples: It can influence further research on suburban design, consumer culture, and the intersection of architecture with social class dynamics during the interwar period​(1 (13))​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Social and Cultural Impact:
Public Engagement: By challenging the dominant architectural narratives, this research could shift public perceptions of suburban spaces, fostering a broader understanding and appreciation for non-modernist aesthetics in everyday life. It highlights the role of nostalgia and tradition in home designs, potentially sparking public interest in historical preservation of suburban housing​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Cultural Heritage: The study contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage by documenting the evolution of domestic space in the UK. This might support efforts to conserve and maintain Tudorbethan and other period suburban homes as part of national heritage​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Policy Influence:
Urban Planning and Housing Policies: This research has the potential to inform policy debates on housing, especially in the context of suburban planning and historical preservation. Policymakers may leverage its findings to craft regulations that support the preservation of historical suburban areas, promote sustainable renovation practices, and highlight the importance of architectural diversity in urban development​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Example: Local governments or heritage bodies could use the study’s findings to justify the protection of interwar suburban homes from demolition or unsympathetic renovation.
4. Sustainability and Environmental Impact:
Renovation over Reconstruction: By encouraging the preservation and thoughtful renovation of suburban homes from the interwar period, the study could contribute to sustainable architectural practices. Renovating existing homes is often more environmentally sustainable than demolishing and rebuilding, as it conserves materials and reduces waste​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Sustainable Development: The study’s discussion of the longevity and adaptability of suburban homes might be used to promote sustainable urban planning strategies that prioritize the renovation of existing structures rather than new construction.
5. Economic Impact:
Heritage Tourism: The preservation of historically significant suburban homes could promote heritage tourism, generating economic benefits for local communities. This is particularly relevant in areas where these homes are seen as part of the cultural landscape​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Housing Market Influence: The study might influence the housing market by encouraging higher valuation for well-preserved interwar suburban homes, which could impact property developers and homebuyers interested in historically significant housing​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Technological and Design Innovation:
Architectural Innovation: Architects and urban planners might draw inspiration from the study's findings to create new suburban housing designs that blend modern amenities with traditional aesthetics. This could result in a resurgence of interest in architectural designs that balance nostalgia with functionality, influencing contemporary housing developments​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Example: Incorporating energy-efficient technologies into the renovation of Tudorbethan homes could combine historical preservation with modern sustainability standards.
7. Public Awareness and Education:
Cultural Awareness Campaigns: This study could be used in educational campaigns to increase public awareness about the historical significance of suburban homes and the importance of preserving domestic spaces that reflect early 20th-century consumer culture. It can also be integrated into museum exhibits or public talks on suburban architecture​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Educational Curricula: The study may contribute to university curricula in architecture, urban planning, and social history, offering students a critical perspective on the evolution of suburban design and domestic spaces during the interwar period​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Health and Well-being Impact:
Impact on Community Well-being: By advocating for the preservation and careful renovation of historical suburban homes, the study may contribute to community well-being by fostering a sense of continuity and belonging among residents. Preserving familiar, historically rich environments can contribute to a community's psychological well-being and collective identity​(impact pathway).
9. Equity and Inclusivity:
Social Class and Consumer Agency: The study’s exploration of suburban spaces through the lens of consumer agency and social class could inform policies and programs aimed at reducing inequality in housing. It highlights how different social classes have historically interacted with suburban housing, potentially influencing modern housing policies to be more inclusive​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Global Suburban Studies: The study’s focus on suburban architecture has global relevance, particularly in countries with similar suburban development patterns (e.g., the US, Australia). Researchers in these countries could apply its insights to explore the intersections of consumer culture, suburban design, and historical preservation in their own contexts​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Scalability and Transferability:
Global Architectural Application: The principles discussed in the study, such as the preservation of suburban homes and the blending of modernity with tradition, can be transferred to suburban developments in other parts of the world, especially where historic suburban neighborhoods are undergoing transformation​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
12. Behavioral Change:
Influencing Consumer Preferences: The research can influence consumer behavior by encouraging homebuyers and homeowners to value architectural history and opt for renovations that maintain historical integrity rather than complete remodels. This shift in consumer preference may lead to greater demand for historically preserved homes​(impact pathway).
Conclusion:
The potential research impacts of the study span academic advancements, social and cultural shifts, policy influence, sustainability, economic benefits, and public awareness. The study offers a deep and broad impact on understanding suburban architecture while promoting the preservation of historically significant domestic spaces and challenging established narratives of Modernism in architecture. The study is likely to have long-lasting effects on cultural heritage, urban planning, and architectural education​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
