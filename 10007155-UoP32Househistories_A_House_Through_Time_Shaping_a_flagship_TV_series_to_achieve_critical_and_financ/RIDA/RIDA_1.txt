Based on the provided research paper "Ideal Homes, 1918-1939" and the extracted insights from the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," I will assess the research across each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research delves into suburban design and architecture between 1918–1939, focusing on how new suburban communities in interwar England shaped domestic space. It emphasizes the "agency of suburbanites as consumers" and critiques the dominance of Modernist design values.
Page Reference: (Introduction, page 6)​(1 (13)).
Example: This work contributes to the Cultural and Artistic Domain by reshaping our understanding of suburban modernism, influencing the historical understanding of domestic design. It also intersects with the Academic Domain by advancing knowledge in social history, gender studies, and cultural geography.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research examines the long-term cultural impacts of suburban modernism, both in its time and how it is lived today. It highlights how 1930s suburban homes serve as a historical template for modern renovations and how the Tudorbethan design aesthetic has persisted over time.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, page 10)​(1 (13)).
Example: The study's long-term impact is in providing a historical foundation for understanding domestic architecture and design that continues to inform contemporary architectural practices, particularly in the renovation of interwar homes.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The primary stakeholders include academics, especially those in the fields of design history, architecture, and cultural history, as well as policymakers who might be involved in heritage and conservation efforts.
Page Reference: (Acknowledgements, page 7)​(1 (13)).
Example: The research benefits academics by contributing to the historical understanding of suburban modernism and domestic design. Additionally, conservationists and urban planners may use these insights to inform the preservation and renovation of suburban homes.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The work offers a deep impact within the field of design history by challenging dominant narratives and offering a new perspective on suburban modernism. It also has a broad impact across multiple disciplines, including social history, architecture, and cultural studies.
Page Reference: (Introduction, page 6)​(1 (13)).
Example: The deep impact is seen in how the study redefines suburban modernism. The broad impact is its interdisciplinary reach, influencing design, cultural history, and gender studies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The study’s findings are transferable to various fields, including urban planning, historical preservation, and interior design. The emphasis on consumer agency in suburban architecture could be scaled to other research on housing developments in different eras and contexts.
Page Reference: (Afterword, page 170)​(1 (13)).
Example: Insights from the research could be applied to current housing trends, particularly in understanding consumer preferences in modern housing developments and renovation projects.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: By contesting the dominance of Modernist design values, the research offers an innovative perspective on suburban architecture, highlighting alternative design aesthetics like Tudorbethan styles.
Page Reference: (Modernisms chapter, page 54)​(1 (13)).
Example: The disruption comes in how the research challenges long-standing design paradigms, proposing a more consumer-driven understanding of suburban architecture during the interwar period.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study’s focus on how suburban homes incorporated nostalgic and modern elements suggests ethical considerations in how communities balance heritage with progress, particularly in housing design that promotes sustainability and a sense of place.
Page Reference: (Nostalgia chapter, page 135)​(1 (13)).
Example: The research can inform sustainable housing practices by looking at historical designs that have endured over time, promoting the reuse and renovation of existing suburban homes rather than new construction.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings have practical applications in the fields of historical preservation and interior design. The work's insights into consumer behavior and the evolution of domestic spaces provide actionable knowledge for urban developers and designers.
Page Reference: (Efficiency chapter, page 93)​(1 (13)).
Example: Urban planners and designers can use the research to guide the renovation of interwar homes, ensuring that modern updates respect historical integrity while improving functionality.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: While focused on English suburban homes, the themes of consumer agency and suburban design aesthetics have global relevance, particularly in countries with similar suburban growth patterns.
Page Reference: (Suburban chapter, page 23)​(1 (13)).
Example: The research’s cross-disciplinary relevance lies in its applicability to studies in architecture, cultural history, and gender studies. Its global relevance can be seen in suburban development studies in the US, Australia, and beyond, where similar housing trends have emerged.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study’s exploration of how suburban homes evolved to meet changing societal norms (e.g., gender roles, family structures) highlights their adaptability over time.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, page 170)​(1 (13)).
Example: The resilience of suburban design, as discussed in the research, can be applied to modern housing developments that need to accommodate shifts in societal values and environmental conditions.
In summary, the research has a profound impact across multiple dimensions, especially in cultural, academic, and architectural domains, and its findings are both deep in specialization and broad in interdisciplinary relevance.
