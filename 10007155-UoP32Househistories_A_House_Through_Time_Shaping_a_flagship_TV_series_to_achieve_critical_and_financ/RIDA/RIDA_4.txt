I have identified the key research impact dimensions based on the study you provided and the predefined instructions. Here is a detailed assessment of the study based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The study investigates the tastes and aspirations of the new suburban communities that emerged in Britain following the First World War" (Introduction, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 72.
Example: The research contributes to the social domain by exploring how architectural preferences reflect broader societal changes. It also touches on the cultural domain by examining how suburban design was influenced by nostalgia for 'Old England,' thus contributing to historical and cultural preservation. It could also impact academic domains such as architectural history and sociology.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "These communities sought out varieties of architecture and design that were both nostalgic and modern" (Results, page 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Results, page 72.
Example: The research could have a long-term impact by forming the basis for future studies in suburban architecture, influencing both academic research in architectural history and the practical conservation of suburban homes as historical artifacts.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The book draws on exhibitions, memoirs, advertisements, and films, as well as surviving examples of suburban architecture and interiors" (Methods, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Methods, page 72.
Example: Stakeholders include architects and urban planners who may benefit from insights into suburban design preferences, as well as historians and cultural heritage professionals involved in the preservation of historical architecture. Local communities living in such homes today also stand to gain from the study's exploration of the social and cultural significance of their neighborhoods.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The ‘ideal’ home of the period was both a retreat from the outside world and a site of change and experimentation" (Results, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Results, page 72.
Example: The research has deep impact within the field of architectural history, particularly regarding interwar British homes. Its breadth of impact spans multiple disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, and urban development, offering insights into how suburban architecture mirrors societal changes.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "It concludes by considering how such houses are lived in today" (Discussion, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 72.
Example: The findings are transferable to other geographic regions experiencing similar suburban development, as well as adaptable to studies of modern-day suburbanization trends. The research could be scaled up to compare suburban developments in other countries, expanding its global relevance.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "Arguing that the ‘ideal’ home of the period was both a retreat from the outside world and a site of change and experimentation" (Results, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Results, page 72.
Example: The research is innovative in its approach to blending architectural design analysis with cultural history. By juxtaposing nostalgia and modernism, it may disrupt conventional approaches to suburban architectural studies, encouraging new perspectives on how homes can function as both personal retreats and sites of innovation.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "How such houses are lived in today" (Discussion, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 72.
Example: The research addresses sustainability in the context of architectural conservation, contributing to discussions on the preservation of historically significant homes. While not explicitly about environmental sustainability, the study’s focus on the long-term preservation of suburban houses touches on sustainable practices in historical preservation.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "Draws on exhibitions, memoirs, advertisements, and films" (Methods, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Methods, page 72.
Example: The research findings could be implemented in museum exhibitions and public history projects to educate the public about interwar suburban architecture. Its usability extends to educational institutions, offering materials that can be incorporated into curriculum design in architectural history and cultural studies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "A distinctively suburban modernism, embodied by the Tudorbethan semi" (Results, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Results, page 72.
Example: The study holds cross-disciplinary relevance for scholars in architecture, cultural studies, and social history. It also has global relevance, as suburbanization is a widespread phenomenon, with implications for housing policy and architectural design globally, particularly in regions undergoing rapid suburban expansion.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The book concludes by considering how such houses are lived in today" (Discussion, p. 72)​(4 (10)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 72.
Example: The research demonstrates resilience by offering historical insights that remain relevant to today’s housing trends. It is adaptable to contemporary studies of urban development, as the insights into interwar suburban homes can inform modern architectural conservation and suburban planning.
This assessment highlights the broad impact and relevance of the study across various fields and disciplines. Each dimension reveals different aspects of how this research contributes to both academic and practical advancements.
