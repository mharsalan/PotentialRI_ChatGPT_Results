I will assess the study for its research impact dimensions based on the provided document and guidelines.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The research explores the transformation of the American kitchen from 1850 to 1950, highlighting its role in domestic life and the influence of technological advancements in appliances and materials.
"This essay explores the changing space and material culture of the American kitchen from 1850 to 1950..." (Abstract, page 1)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: The study primarily impacts the cultural and historical domain by providing insight into how domestic spaces evolved over time. It also touches upon the economic domain as it discusses the rise of factory-made kitchen furniture and household appliances. These insights are relevant to historians, cultural analysts, and designers.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The research traces the long-term changes in kitchen design and its relationship to domestic life over a century.
"The kitchen was returned to the heart of the home..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The study’s impact is long-term, as it contributes to the understanding of the transformation of domestic life over an extended period. The findings could serve as foundational knowledge for future studies on domestic architecture, social history, and gender roles in household management.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The stakeholders include scholars in the fields of history, sociology, and cultural studies, as well as designers and manufacturers.
"These shifts in the location of the kitchen were intrinsically tied to the role of the mistress of the house..." (Abstract, page 1)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: Direct stakeholders include researchers in domestic history and material culture, while indirect stakeholders include modern-day kitchen designers, manufacturers, and sociologists who may use the insights to inform future designs or studies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research has both deep and broad implications, offering a detailed exploration of the American kitchen's evolution while also addressing broader cultural trends such as gender roles and domestic labor.
"This facilitated the kitchen’s redesignation as a combined living and workspace..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The research has a deep impact in the niche area of domestic history and kitchen design but also has broad implications for understanding gender roles and societal expectations within the domestic sphere.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The findings of the study on kitchen evolution and labor-saving appliances can be applied to other contexts beyond the United States, offering insights into how domestic spaces evolve globally in response to technological advancements.
"Labour-saving appliances were said to take the place of servants..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The research findings can be scaled up to include other countries where kitchen evolution followed similar patterns due to industrialization. It can also be transferred to contemporary studies of modern kitchens in different cultural contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: The study highlights innovations in kitchen design, such as the work triangle and labor-saving appliances, which disrupted traditional domestic work patterns.
"The introduction of the work triangle in galley, U or L-shaped floor plans..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The innovation lies in the analysis of kitchen design and the work triangle, which changed the way kitchens were used and designed. The disruption occurred as these innovations reduced the need for domestic servants and fundamentally altered domestic labor practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: While the study does not explicitly focus on sustainability, it touches upon how the shift to labor-saving appliances and reduced kitchen sizes impacted domestic life.
"New chemicals, detergents, and washable wallpaper... facilitated hygiene." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The research indirectly addresses sustainability by examining how innovations in kitchen appliances and materials reduced labor and improved hygiene. Ethically, it considers the shifting role of women in the household as technology evolved.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The research provides usable insights for historians, designers, and manufacturers by tracing the evolution of kitchen spaces and materials.
"Furniture and cabinetry took on an increasingly factory-like appearance..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The findings can be implemented in design studies and used by manufacturers to create historically informed kitchen products that blend modern and traditional elements.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The study crosses disciplines by combining cultural history, sociology, and material culture analysis.
"The origins of the American kitchen are in the Colonial ‘keeping room’..." (Abstract, page 1)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Abstract, page 1.
Example: The research is relevant across disciplines such as history, architecture, and sociology. It also has global relevance as it can inform studies of domestic spaces in other cultures that experienced similar transformations due to industrialization.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The study’s findings are resilient, as they trace changes over a century and provide a foundation for future research on domestic spaces.
"The kitchen was returned to the heart of the home..." (Discussion, page 5)​(2 (11)).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 5.
Example: The research is resilient, as its findings on the evolution of kitchen spaces remain relevant for studies on modern domestic design. The insights can adapt to contemporary discussions on sustainability and gender roles in the home.
This analysis provides a detailed overview of how the study impacts each of the top 10 research dimensions, ensuring its contribution is assessed across multiple sectors and timeframes.
