Based on the information from the file, here are the Research Impact Dimensions applied to the study in detail:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Domain: The research primarily influences the field of psychiatric care and mental health nursing. It adds to academic knowledge by identifying patterns in conflict and containment incidents in psychiatric settings. The findings contribute to psychology, nursing studies, and mental health management, providing a foundation for further research on patient care in acute psychiatric wards​(3 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Social Domain: This study influences the social domain by identifying strategies that could improve patient safety and staff interactions. It has the potential to reduce incidents of aggression, enhancing the overall well-being of psychiatric patients and reducing the social stigma associated with aggressive behavior in these settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Health Domain: This research has a direct impact on healthcare practices by contributing to better management of patient behavior in acute psychiatric wards. By exploring the sequence of conflict events, the study informs interventions that can reduce harmful outcomes, improving both patient and staff safety​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Policy Domain: The findings could influence hospital policy by recommending practices that minimize coercive interventions like seclusion and restraint, aligning with ethical healthcare standards and improving care policies in psychiatric hospitals​(3 (2)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: In the short term, the study offers immediate improvements to psychiatric care by providing insights into conflict patterns and suggesting ways to reduce aggressive incidents. This could lead to rapid changes in staff training and patient management techniques​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: The long-term impact includes the study’s contribution to mental health care policy and the development of non-coercive interventions. Over time, the research could lead to systemic changes in how psychiatric care is delivered globally, influencing both clinical practice and ethical standards in patient care​(3 (2)).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The main stakeholders are psychiatric nurses, hospital administrators, and mental health professionals who directly benefit from the research by implementing the recommended strategies in their daily work to manage patient conflict more effectively​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: Patients and their families benefit indirectly as the research promotes safer care environments and reduces the use of forceful interventions. Policy makers and healthcare regulators could also benefit from the study by using it to inform hospital safety standards​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study provides a deep impact within the field of psychiatric care by offering detailed analysis and management strategies for conflict in acute psychiatric settings. It advances the understanding of how certain behaviors lead to containment actions, directly affecting clinical practice​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Broad Impact: The findings can be applied beyond psychiatric care to general healthcare settings, particularly in areas involving patient aggression, behavioral management, and de-escalation strategies. Its cross-disciplinary relevance makes it applicable to nursing and psychology fields​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study’s recommendations for managing psychiatric conflict could be scaled up to apply in multiple psychiatric hospitals across different regions, improving patient outcomes on a larger scale. It offers scalable methods for reducing conflict in wards through staff training and structured interventions​(3 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The principles and strategies from this research could be transferred to other healthcare disciplines that manage aggressive or conflict-prone patients, including emergency rooms or rehabilitation centers​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces new frameworks for understanding the sequence of conflict and containment events, which can lead to innovative strategies for managing aggression in healthcare settings​(3 (2)).
Disruption: It could potentially disrupt traditional methods of patient care by advocating for less coercive and more patient-centered interventions, challenging the status quo of psychiatric care where restraint and seclusion are commonly used​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: By reducing the use of coercive methods in psychiatric care, the study promotes sustainable healthcare practices that prioritize patient safety, well-being, and ethical treatment​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The study addresses key ethical concerns in psychiatric care, such as minimizing the use of force and maximizing patient comfort. It aligns with modern healthcare ethics that emphasize patient autonomy and dignity​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability: The study provides practical recommendations for frontline healthcare workers. By identifying specific conflict sequences, it helps psychiatric nurses and staff implement targeted interventions that are easy to adopt in real-time patient care scenarios​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: While focused on psychiatric nursing, the study’s insights are relevant to other fields, such as social work, criminal justice, and general healthcare where managing conflict is essential​(3 (2)).
Global Relevance: The study’s recommendations for reducing conflict and coercion in psychiatric care are applicable to healthcare systems globally, particularly in countries looking to improve mental health services and align with ethical standards​(3 (2)).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The methods proposed in the study are designed to be adaptable to various psychiatric settings, ensuring that they can withstand changes in patient populations or healthcare policies​(3 (2)).
Adaptability: The conflict management strategies are adaptable to different cultural and institutional contexts, making them suitable for application in both developed and developing countries​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
These research impact dimensions demonstrate that the study has significant potential to influence academic research, clinical practice, and healthcare policies in psychiatric settings, with wide-reaching impacts across various domains.
