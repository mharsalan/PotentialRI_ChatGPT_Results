Based on the detailed text provided, the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Reducing conflict and containment rates on acute psychiatric wards: The Safewards cluster randomised controlled trial" can be mapped as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Impact: The Safewards model makes a significant contribution to the academic field of psychiatry and mental health nursing. It provides new insights and interventions that can be applied to reduce conflict and containment, advancing knowledge on managing patient behavior in psychiatric wards.
Health Impact: The Safewards interventions directly improve patient care by reducing the need for coercive measures like seclusion and restraint, positively impacting the well-being and safety of patients in psychiatric settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The Safewards interventions offer immediate improvements in ward safety by reducing incidents of aggression and the need for containment measures like restraint​(5).
Long-term Impact: Over time, these interventions could become embedded in psychiatric care protocols globally, contributing to sustained improvements in patient care and institutional safety​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Psychiatric ward staff, including nurses and healthcare assistants, are the direct beneficiaries as the interventions provide tools for managing conflict more effectively.
Indirect Stakeholders: Patients and their families benefit from a safer care environment, while policymakers and mental health authorities can use the findings to inform policy and improve healthcare systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The Safewards model deeply influences psychiatric care by providing a framework for understanding and managing conflict in wards. It has the potential to reshape how mental health professionals approach patient care.
Broad Impact: Beyond psychiatry, the conflict management strategies developed in this study could be applied to other healthcare settings, such as emergency departments or long-term care facilities​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The Safewards model can be scaled up for implementation in psychiatric institutions worldwide, making it an effective solution for improving safety in mental health wards.
Transferability: The conflict management strategies are transferable to other healthcare domains, such as emergency care or even education and social services, where conflict resolution is essential​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The Safewards interventions introduce new, non-coercive methods for managing patient aggression, offering innovative alternatives to traditional approaches like restraint or seclusion.
Disruption: The model challenges the status quo by promoting less forceful interventions, potentially disrupting existing practices that rely heavily on physical restraint and seclusion​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The model promotes more sustainable psychiatric care by reducing the physical and emotional toll on both staff and patients, contributing to a more humane and ethically responsible approach to mental health care.
Ethical Considerations: By minimizing the use of coercive interventions, the Safewards model aligns with modern ethical standards, prioritizing patient dignity and autonomy​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
8. Implementation and Usability
The Safewards model is highly usable in real-world settings, offering practical, easy-to-implement interventions that can be adopted quickly by psychiatric wards. The study includes training and instructional materials to ensure successful implementation​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The conflict management strategies proposed by Safewards can be applied in various fields beyond psychiatry, such as nursing, emergency medicine, and even education.
Global Relevance: The Safewards model has universal relevance, making it applicable across different healthcare systems worldwide, especially in regions looking to reform mental health care practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The model is adaptable to different psychiatric settings and patient populations, ensuring it can be effectively implemented across diverse environments. Its resilience allows it to remain relevant despite changes in ward dynamics or staffing​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(5).
This mapping shows how the Safewards cluster randomised controlled trial has the potential for significant research impact across various domains, offering both immediate and long-term benefits to psychiatric care and broader healthcare practices.
