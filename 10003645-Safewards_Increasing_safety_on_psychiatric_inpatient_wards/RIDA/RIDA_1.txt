Based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact from the attached document, I will provide a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions of the study.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Domain: The study significantly contributes to mental health nursing and psychiatric care by offering insights into the Safewards Model. The research provides empirical evidence that is crucial for academic discussions on conflict and containment in psychiatric wards, expanding the knowledge base in nursing and mental health studies.
Social Domain: It has strong implications for social policies regarding the management of psychiatric wards. By addressing safety, conflict, and containment, the research informs hospital administration and healthcare practices to create safer environments, potentially reducing conflict among patients and improving staff-patient interactions​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (1)).
Health Domain: The research offers concrete contributions to healthcare practices by identifying methods to reduce conflict and improve patient outcomes in acute psychiatric settings. This can lead to better patient care and reduced use of restrictive interventions, benefiting both healthcare providers and patients​(1 (1)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The research provides immediate practical applications by offering actionable insights for psychiatric ward management. The Safewards Model, supported by empirical evidence, can be applied directly to reduce conflict and containment incidents in the short term​(1 (1)).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the study may influence the structuring of psychiatric care policies and training programs for staff, contributing to long-term improvements in how psychiatric wards are managed. Its recommendations could shape future healthcare frameworks and mental health policies for years to come​(1 (1)).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The primary beneficiaries are psychiatric healthcare providers, including nurses, hospital administrators, and psychiatric staff, who can apply the Safewards Model to improve ward environments.
Indirect Stakeholders: Patients on psychiatric wards benefit indirectly from the safer and more structured environments created through the application of the study’s findings. Policymakers and healthcare regulators may also utilize this research to inform healthcare regulations and improve public mental health policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (1)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The research has a profound impact on mental health care, specifically in the niche area of conflict management within psychiatric settings. It provides new models and interventions that can deeply change practices in psychiatric wards​(1 (1)).
Broad Impact: Beyond psychiatric care, the principles of reducing conflict through environmental and staff interventions can be applied in other healthcare settings, such as rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, and general hospitals, offering a wider influence across health services​(1 (1))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The Safewards Model has the potential to be scaled from individual psychiatric wards to entire healthcare systems, improving conflict management practices across hospitals globally​(1 (1)).
Transferability: The findings can be transferred to other healthcare disciplines, such as elderly care or child and adolescent psychiatric services, offering a framework for managing conflict and improving patient-staff relations in various medical environments​(1 (1)).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The Safewards Model introduces innovative strategies for managing conflict and containment, providing novel interventions like staff training and environmental modifications that reduce aggression and improve ward dynamics​(1 (1)).
Disruption: By challenging the conventional use of seclusion and restraint, the study disrupts traditional approaches to managing psychiatric patients, advocating for less invasive, more supportive methods of care​(1 (1))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The model promotes sustainable healthcare practices by offering methods that reduce staff burnout and improve patient outcomes without resorting to excessive containment measures. This contributes to long-term sustainability in mental healthcare​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The reduction of seclusion and restraint aligns with ethical imperatives in healthcare to treat patients with dignity and minimize harm. The study’s recommendations advocate for more humane approaches to psychiatric care​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (1)).
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability: The Safewards Model is highly usable for healthcare practitioners, as it provides clear, evidence-based interventions that can be directly applied in ward management. Its practical focus on staff-patient interactions, environmental factors, and regulatory frameworks makes it easily implementable across psychiatric wards​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(1 (1)).
Practical Tools: The study’s model includes tools like structured interventions, making it an immediately actionable framework for psychiatric professionals to reduce conflict and containment​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: Although focused on psychiatric wards, the research can be applied to other disciplines, such as psychology, social work, and nursing, enhancing how professionals manage behavioral issues in various settings. The interdisciplinary relevance extends into healthcare administration and policy-making​(1 (1))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The study’s findings are applicable to psychiatric services globally, offering a model that can be adapted to different healthcare systems worldwide, especially where psychiatric care is under-resourced or over-reliant on coercive methods​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The Safewards Model is resilient in that it provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to different ward conditions, staff compositions, and patient populations. It offers solutions that are adaptable to a wide range of psychiatric settings​(1 (1)).
Adaptability: The research’s recommendations can be adapted to various institutional settings beyond psychiatric wards, offering broad applicability in healthcare systems seeking to reduce conflict and improve patient care​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This detailed analysis shows how the study aligns with the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions, offering broad, deep, and scalable contributions to psychiatric care, healthcare policy, and conflict management practices.
