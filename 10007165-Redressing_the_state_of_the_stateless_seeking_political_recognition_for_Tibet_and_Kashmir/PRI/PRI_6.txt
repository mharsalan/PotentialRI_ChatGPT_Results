Based on my analysis of the attached study titled "Rise of the Political Right in India: Hindutva-Development Mix, Modi Myth, and Dualities" and in alignment with predefined research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts organized by impact types:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Political Science Theories: The study provides in-depth analysis on the rise of right-wing populism, particularly how cultural nationalism (Hindutva) merges with neoliberal economic policies under Modi's leadership. This can contribute to political science theories on populism and governance.
Interdisciplinary Academic Research: The research draws from political science, economics, and cultural studies, offering a new interdisciplinary framework to understand populism in the Global South.
Advancing Comparative Political Studies: The study’s comparative approach, drawing parallels between Indian populism and global right-wing movements, enhances the literature on comparative political systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Influencing Public Discourse on Nationalism and Identity: By analyzing how Hindutva influences Indian identity, the study helps in raising public awareness about the socio-cultural implications of cultural nationalism. This may influence public debates on religious identity, inclusivity, and citizenship in India.
Impact on Media and Political Communication: The framing of the "Modi Myth" could affect how media narratives are constructed around populist figures in India, influencing both political campaigns and the electorate’s perceptions​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Policy and Political Impact
Policy Influence on Populism and Neoliberalism: The study’s insights into the combination of neoliberalism with cultural nationalism may guide policymakers in better understanding the impact of right-wing populist policies on economic and social development in India and similar contexts​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Shaping Political Strategies: The analysis of electoral strategies and Modi’s political rhetoric can inform future political campaigns, both for and against similar populist movements​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Economic Impact
Economic Policy Analysis: The study's exploration of neoliberal economic policies under Modi can provide insights into their long-term impact on India's economic structure, particularly their effects on the middle class and marginalized groups​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Potential Economic Modeling of Neoliberal Populism: Researchers can use the findings to model economic implications of merging populist politics with neoliberal economics in emerging markets​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Political Engagement and Advocacy
Advocacy for Political Inclusivity: The study’s critique of Hindutva’s exclusionary practices could fuel advocacy for more inclusive governance and electoral reforms in India. Social movements or NGOs focused on rights and democracy may use the research to campaign for reforms​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Impact on Democratic Practices: Insights from the study can contribute to global discussions on maintaining democratic principles in the face of rising populism, with applications in policy-making for other democracies experiencing similar right-wing trends​(impact pathway).
6. Global Relevance and Cross-disciplinary Impact
Global Understanding of Right-Wing Populism: The research provides a framework for understanding right-wing populism not just in India but also in global contexts, making it relevant for scholars studying similar movements in countries such as the U.S., Brazil, and parts of Europe​(Common Research Impact …).
Cross-disciplinary Impact on Political Science and Cultural Studies: The blend of cultural identity and economic policy invites collaboration across political science, economics, sociology, and cultural studies to further explore populist movements globally​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Critique of Polarizing Populism: The study raises concerns about the ethical implications of Hindutva’s divisive approach, especially in the context of increasing polarization. This contributes to long-term discussions on the sustainability of democratic institutions under populist regimes​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
8. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness of Political Strategies: The study’s insights can be used to educate the public about the dangers of populism mixed with religious nationalism, fostering more informed public discourse and enhancing political literacy in India and beyond​(impact pathway).
Inclusion in Educational Curricula: The research could be integrated into university curricula in political science, sociology, and cultural studies, further influencing how the next generation understands the rise of global populist movements​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Technological and Communication Impact
Influence on Digital Media Narratives: By examining Modi's use of media to craft his political persona, the study impacts how digital communication and political narratives are analyzed, potentially influencing future political communication strategies​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Community and Civil Society Engagement
Empowering Grassroots Movements: The findings could empower community organizations and grassroots movements focused on preserving democratic values and countering exclusionary politics​(impact pathway).
11. Long-Term Societal Impact
Foundation for Future Research on Populism: The study serves as a foundational piece for future research into how right-wing populist movements evolve, helping societies develop resilience against such political strategies over time​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
This broad array of impacts demonstrates how this study extends beyond academia, influencing policy, culture, public understanding, and global dialogues about political trends.
