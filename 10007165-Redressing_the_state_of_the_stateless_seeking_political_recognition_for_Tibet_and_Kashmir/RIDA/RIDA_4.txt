Example: This research has long-term impact as it forms a basis for continued exploration into gender relations in conflict zones, contributing to foundational knowledge in both feminist studies and conflict theory.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "This work holds value for scholars, policymakers, and human rights organizations working on gender equality and democratic processes in conflict areas." (Discussion, page 140).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 140.
Example: The direct stakeholders include researchers in feminist and conflict studies, while indirect stakeholders include policymakers and human rights organizations working in the area of conflict resolution and gender rights.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "By intertwining gender, nationalism, and democracy, this study opens up interdisciplinary dialogue, influencing feminist theory, political science, and conflict studies." (Introduction, page 128).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 128.
Example: The research has deep impact within feminist studies, by exploring new intersections between gender and nationalism, and broad impact across multiple disciplines, including political science and human rights studies.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The analytical framework developed here can be applied to other conflict regions where gender violence and nationalism intersect." (Discussion, page 141).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 141.
Example: The research demonstrates transferability, as its framework can be adapted to analyze gender dynamics in other militarized conflict regions globally, from Palestine to Myanmar.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The study challenges the dominant nationalist narratives by offering a gendered critique of state violence and its legitimization through democratic processes." (Results, page 135).
Page Reference and Section: Results, page 135.
Example: This research is disruptive as it challenges traditional nationalistic narratives, offering a new perspective on the gendered dimensions of conflict, which may change how scholars and policymakers approach such issues in future discourses.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The ethical stance of this research is clear in its commitment to highlighting human rights violations and gender-based violence in conflict zones." (Methods, page 131).
Page Reference and Section: Methods, page 131.
Example: The research addresses ethical considerations by focusing on human rights abuses and promoting the protection of marginalized populations, making it ethically sound in advancing social justice in conflict zones.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "This research offers a framework that can guide policymakers and international organizations in their approach to conflict resolution and gender equity in militarized zones." (Discussion, page 142).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 142.
Example: The usability of this research is high as it provides practical insights for human rights organizations and policymakers on gender-sensitive approaches to conflict resolution.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "This study has relevance not only in the Indian context but globally, as it addresses common themes of nationalism, democracy, and gender violence across various conflict zones." (Introduction, page 128).
Page Reference and Section: Introduction, page 128.
Example: The research has global relevance, as its themes of gender, democracy, and nationalism are applicable in conflict zones worldwide, making it a significant cross-disciplinary contribution to both regional and global studies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "By addressing the ongoing conflict in Kashmir through multiple lenses, the study remains relevant and adaptable as the situation evolves." (Discussion, page 143).
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, page 143.
Example: The research demonstrates resilience by offering adaptable frameworks for analyzing ongoing and evolving conflicts, ensuring its relevance in long-term academic and policy discussions.
These dimensions capture the multifaceted impact of the study on academic, social, and political domains, with long-lasting implications for both scholarly work and real-world applications in conflict resolution and gender justice.
