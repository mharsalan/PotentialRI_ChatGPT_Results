I have reviewed the attached document and assessed the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Rise of the Political Right in India: Hindutva-Development Mix, Modi Myth, and Dualities." Here is the detailed analysis based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
"The rise of Narendra Modi and his BJP-led government is a complex political phenomenon, characterized by a Hindutva-nationalist rhetoric combined with neoliberal economic policies." (Introduction, page 6).
"The combination of right-wing nationalism and neoliberalism in India has significantly impacted various domains, from cultural identity politics to economic policies." (Discussion, page 23).

Example:
The research has a broad impact across multiple domains:

Political Domain: It influences political science by analyzing the rise of populist politics.
Cultural Domain: It informs the understanding of nationalism and identity politics in India.
Economic Domain: It explores the intersection between economic neoliberalism and nationalism.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
"The narrative of Modi as the ‘Development Man’ combined with Hindutva ideology will continue to influence Indian politics for years to come." (Results, page 22).
"The long-term implications of this right-wing shift in Indian politics are likely to affect future political discourse and electoral strategies." (Discussion, page 25).

Example:
This research has long-term impact on political science by shaping future studies of right-wing politics in postcolonial societies. The analysis of Modi's rise will influence discussions on populism for decades.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
"This study offers insights for scholars of political science, particularly those focused on right-wing populism and nationalism." (Discussion, page 24).
"It also informs policymakers and political analysts seeking to understand the appeal of neoliberalism in right-wing politics." (Discussion, page 25).

Example:
The direct stakeholders include:

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
"The research provides an in-depth analysis of how Modi’s dual rhetoric appeals to both neoliberal economic policies and Hindutva cultural values." (Results, page 19).
"This dual approach has ramifications not just for India but also for understanding similar right-wing movements globally." (Discussion, page 27).

Example:
The study has deep impact in the field of political science by offering a comprehensive model of right-wing populism, and broad impact by drawing comparisons to global phenomena such as Trumpism.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
"The framework for analyzing the Modi myth and dualities in policy can be applied to other global contexts where neoliberalism intersects with nationalist politics." (Discussion, page 28).

Example:
This research is transferable to studies of right-wing politics in other countries, such as the U.S. under Trump or Brazil under Bolsonaro. The ideological framework is also scalable, applicable to broader analyses of neoliberalism and nationalism.

"The analysis disrupts traditional views of nationalism and neoliberalism as distinct forces, showing how they are in fact intertwined in Modi’s political strategy." (Results, page 21).

Example:
The research offers disruptive potential by challenging established views in political science. It innovatively ties together neoliberalism and cultural nationalism, reshaping the theoretical landscape.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
"The study raises concerns about the ethical implications of populist strategies that use identity politics to divert attention from economic issues." (Discussion, page 26).

Example:

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
"This research can be used by political analysts to develop strategies for addressing the rise of right-wing populism in their own countries." (Discussion, page 27).

Example:
The findings are highly usable for political analysts, campaigners, and policymakers seeking to counteract populist rhetoric or understand its appeal.

"The relevance of this study extends globally, with implications for understanding right-wing populism in both the Global North and South." (Discussion, page 28).

Example:
The study has cross-disciplinary relevance in political science, economics, and cultural studies. It is also globally relevant by offering a comparative analysis of right-wing populism in various countries.

Section and Page Reference: Introduction, page 7; Discussion, page 28.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
"The duality of Modi’s messaging, with its focus on Hindutva and development, has proven adaptable to changing political and economic conditions in India." (Results, page 20).

Example:
