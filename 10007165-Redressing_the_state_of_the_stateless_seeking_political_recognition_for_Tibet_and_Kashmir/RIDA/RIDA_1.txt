Based on the provided content, I have mapped the findings of the research paper to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" and will now present the detailed analysis.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The research discusses Western representations of Tibet, highlighting the cultural, political, and academic domains in which the study exerts influence. This cross-boundary analysis of representation affects not only international relations (IR) but also cultural studies, identity studies, and political science.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, p. 131)​(1).
Example: The research contributes to both the academic domain by offering new insights into postcolonial theory and the cultural domain by deconstructing Western portrayals of Tibet and Tibetan identity.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The study’s impact can be seen in its ability to change long-term academic perspectives, particularly in international relations and postcolonial studies. It lays the groundwork for future research in IR and Tibetan cultural representation.
Page Reference: (Introduction, p. 1)​(1).
Example: This research will likely have a long-term impact by providing foundational knowledge that future scholars can use to explore identity formation and the implications of Western cultural representations in world politics.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The key stakeholders in this research include scholars of international relations, postcolonial theorists, and those in cultural studies who study identity and representation. Additionally, it indirectly impacts policymakers by influencing how Tibetan identity and culture are perceived globally.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, p. 132)​(1).
Example: The research benefits both academic researchers in IR and policymakers, as it informs the geopolitical understanding of Tibet and Chinese-Tibetan relations, which may influence policy debates and decisions on international relations with China and Tibet.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research offers deep impact within the field of postcolonial theory by introducing new critiques of Western imperialist representations of Tibet. Simultaneously, it has broad impact across multiple fields including politics, culture, and identity studies.
Page Reference: (Postcoloniality, p. 15)​(1).
Example: In deep impact, the research advances postcolonial critiques and contributes to evolving discussions in international relations. In broad impact, it influences cross-disciplinary fields such as anthropology, political science, and media studies, where representations of non-Western cultures are critical.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The research’s critical framework can be transferred to analyze Western representations of other non-Western cultures beyond Tibet, allowing it to influence broader discussions in both IR and cultural studies.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, p. 133)​(1).
Example: The study's critical tools for analyzing cultural representations can be scaled up to examine the portrayal of other regions and peoples, such as Indigenous cultures or other colonized societies, broadening its applicability in both academic and policy-making contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: By challenging traditional Western-centric views in IR, the research introduces an innovative postcolonial critique, disrupting standard narratives and offering a new lens for analyzing global politics.
Page Reference: (Postcoloniality and Reimagining, p. 131)​(1).
Example: The disruptive potential lies in its ability to reshape academic discourse, especially in Western IR studies, by incorporating non-Western perspectives and emphasizing the role of representation in shaping political identities.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The ethical dimension of the research involves advocating for a more balanced and sensitive portrayal of Tibetan identity, countering the historical misrepresentations that have often been politically motivated.
Page Reference: (Poetics of Exotica, p. 37)​(1).
Example: The research aligns with ethical considerations by promoting the fair representation of Tibetans, which is critical in ensuring that the cultural identity of Tibet is preserved and not distorted by dominant Western narratives.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: This research can be implemented in both academic curricula, particularly in postcolonial studies and cultural critique, and in international relations think tanks or advisory bodies that deal with Chinese-Tibetan relations.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, p. 133)​(1).
Example: In academia, the findings can be used to educate students on the implications of Western cultural domination. For policymakers, it can offer a more nuanced perspective on Tibet, encouraging more culturally sensitive foreign policies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The research cuts across disciplines such as political science, international relations, and cultural studies, making it relevant to a global audience interested in understanding the impacts of representation and identity politics.
Page Reference: (Introduction, p. 1)​(1).
Example: The global relevance of the research extends to IR scholars and policymakers worldwide, as it offers new insights into how cultural identities are shaped by global power dynamics, impacting not only Tibetan studies but also broader postcolonial discourses globally.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The study’s framework is adaptable to different contexts and has the resilience to remain relevant in future studies of postcolonial identity and international relations.
Page Reference: (Conclusion, p. 132)​(1).
Example: The adaptability of this research allows it to be applied in different geopolitical contexts, making it useful for future analyses of other regions with similar colonial histories, ensuring its continued impact in IR studies.
This summary provides a comprehensive mapping of the research findings to the 10 dimensions of research impact, demonstrating its broad influence across multiple fields, stakeholders, and potential long-term applications.
