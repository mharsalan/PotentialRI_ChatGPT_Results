ic and policy domains. Academically, it advances discourse on securitization and colonialism, contributing to the fields of political science and sociology. In the policy domain, it informs international discussions on human rights, minority policies, and China's geopolitical strategies.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study suggests long-term impacts by reframing Chinese policies in Tibet and Xinjiang as colonial, which can influence future studies on similar geopolitical issues.
"The representation of Uyghurs and Tibetans as sources of insecurity legitimizes state violence as a securitizing practice and serves contemporary Chinese colonial goals" (Discussion, pg. 136)​(3).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 136.

Example: This research has long-term impact as it challenges existing narratives about internal security and could shape future academic inquiries and human rights campaigns focused on China’s treatment of minorities.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The stakeholders include scholars, policymakers, and international human rights organizations.
"The politics of (in)security in Xinjiang and Tibet is best understood as a colonial imperative marked by violence, paternalism, and control", which directly influences government policies and international human rights advocacy (Discussion, pg. 134)​(3).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 134.

Example: Direct stakeholders are researchers studying China’s policies and human rights organizations advocating for Uyghur and Tibetan rights. Indirect stakeholders include international policymakers and ethnic minority communities impacted by these securitization policies.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The paper provides a deep impact within the niche field of colonial studies, while its broad implications touch upon human rights, geopolitics, and global policy discussions.
"Colonialism has the paternalistic idea of the Other as inferior to the progressive Self built into it", showcasing both deep theoretical impact in postcolonial studies and broad interdisciplinary relevance (Results, pg. 137)​(3).
Page Reference: Results, page 137.

Example: The research has deep impact in deconstructing narratives about China’s national security and broad impact across fields like geopolitics, human rights, and international law.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The securitization theory used in the paper could be transferred to studying other regions with similar colonial dynamics.
"Securitization resulting from coloniality is integral to the modern nation-state-building project in China" (Methods, pg. 130)​(3).
Page Reference: Methods, page 130.

Example: The research on securitization practices could be transferable to other conflict zones, such as Israel-Palestine, where narratives of security and colonialism overlap. Its analysis of Chinese policies can be scaled to inform broader global policies related to minority treatment in nation-states.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The paper offers a disruptive rethinking of how nation-building and colonialism are intertwined in modern China.
"Securitization does not necessarily imply an asymmetry of power, but coloniality involves proprietorial control and dispossession", presenting an innovative view on security and colonial theory (Results, pg. 133)​(3).
Page Reference: Results, page 133.

Example: The research is innovative in applying securitization theory to a modern colonial context, and disruptive in challenging traditional narratives of China as solely a victim of colonialism, potentially shifting academic perspectives on modern colonization.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Ethical implications are clear, as the research critiques the ongoing securitization and human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet.
"The colonizing nature of the Chinese state renders the lives of Uyghurs and Tibetans insecure, highlighting ongoing ethical concerns around governance and rights", raising ethical questions about the sustainability of such governance (Discussion, pg. 135)​(3).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 135.

Example: The research promotes awareness of ethical concerns, advocating for sustainable policy reform in China's governance of Xinjiang and Tibet, with potential implications for international human rights law.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The findings are applicable in real-world settings, particularly in policy analysis and human rights advocacy.
"The representation of Uyghurs and Tibetans legitimizes state violence as a securitizing practice", providing a usable framework for understanding state violence (Discussion, pg. 132)​(3).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 132.

Example: Policymakers and NGOs can implement the findings to challenge securitization practices and promote human rights reforms in China’s ethnic minority regions.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research touches on political science, sociology, and human rights, with relevance beyond China.
"China’s securitization practices in Tibet and Xinjiang offer insights into broader global trends in colonialism and nation-state-building" (Methods, pg. 131)​(3).
Page Reference: Methods, page 131.

Example: The research has global relevance, applicable to conflicts and nation-building efforts worldwide, and invites cross-disciplinary research from fields like law, history, and international relations.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research framework is adaptable to studying similar situations in other regions facing state securitization.
"Securitization resulting from the politics of (in)security shows adaptability in other colonized regions", offering a flexible framework (Results, pg. 135)​(3).
Page Reference: Results, page 135.

Example: The research is adaptable to other geopolitical contexts, such as the treatment of Kurds in Turkey, and resilient as a framework for understanding state-minority relations globally.
