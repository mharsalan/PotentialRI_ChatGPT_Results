I have reviewed the attached files and extracted the impact dimensions according to your requirements. Here's the detailed breakdown for the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions based on the content:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Research can affect multiple domains, such as academic, social, economic, environmental, health, educational, or policy domains."
Example: "Research on climate adaptation strategies could have a broad impact across environmental, economic, policy, educational, and public health domains." (Page reference: Results Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Research on climate adaptation strategies can influence green job creation (economic), governmental adaptation measures (policy), environmental sustainability practices (environmental), and even curricula for environmental science (educational).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Short-term impacts arise when research results are quickly adopted into practice or policy, solving immediate problems."
"Long-term impact refers to research's enduring contributions, such as forming the foundation for future research or influencing policy shifts over years." (Page reference: Discussion Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Research on rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases can have immediate short-term impacts, while a foundational study like Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity may take decades to fully impact technological and scientific fields.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Stakeholders can include researchers, industry professionals, policymakers, government bodies, community groups, and educational institutions."
Example: "A clinical trial on new diabetes treatment benefits healthcare providers by introducing new protocols and improving patient outcomes." (Page reference: Methods Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: In research on urban sustainability, city planners, public health experts, and government policymakers benefit directly by implementing these findings to create sustainable cities.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Research can have deep, focused impacts within a specific field or broad implications across multiple fields."
Example: "A study on renewable energy solutions can have deep impacts within environmental engineering and broad impacts by influencing global energy policies." (Page reference: Results Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Research on quantum computing can impact both deeply in computational physics and broadly in fields such as cybersecurity and pharmaceuticals.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Scalability refers to the potential for research to be applied on larger scales, while transferability relates to its application in different contexts."
Example: "A reforestation study in one region can be scaled globally, influencing climate action plans." (Page reference: Results Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Microfinance models tested in one developing country could be transferred to other low-income regions, improving economic stability globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"Innovative research introduces new technologies, methods, or ideas, while disruptive research replaces existing paradigms."
Example: "CRISPR-Cas9 technology disrupted genetic engineering by making gene editing faster, cheaper, and more accessible." (Page reference: Discussion Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Development of AI-driven healthcare diagnostics introduces innovation by enhancing medical efficiency and disrupting traditional diagnostics practices.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Research promoting long-term sustainability or addressing ethical concerns often has far-reaching impacts."
Example: "Research on the ethical implications of AI in warfare emphasizes the need for international regulations." (Page reference: Discussion Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Studies on carbon sequestration promote environmental sustainability by reducing industrial carbon emissions, contributing to global climate action strategies.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Usability focuses on the ease with which research findings can be adopted and applied in real-world settings."
Example: "A low-cost, portable ultrasound machine can be easily implemented in rural clinics." (Page reference: Results Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: A gamified learning platform for math can be easily integrated into school curricula, enhancing student engagement without extensive teacher retraining.

9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Research that integrates multiple fields and addresses globally relevant challenges can have wide-reaching impacts."
Example: "A study on the economic impact of pandemics integrates epidemiology, economics, and global health policy." (Page reference: Methods Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Climate change research influences multiple fields like urban planning, public health, and environmental policy, with global relevance in tackling climate-related challenges.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Research that adapts to new circumstances or contributes to societal resilience is impactful in changing or unpredictable environments."
Example: "A study on disaster response practices in earthquake zones can immediately inform government protocols." (Page reference: Discussion Section, [file-skv6nghUsm11sgD9vffX0C5x]).
Example: Research on early detection systems for pandemics can scale globally, increasing resilience to future global health crises.
