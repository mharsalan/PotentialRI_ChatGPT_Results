Based on the provided research document and predefined impact dimensions, here is an analysis of the research's impact across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The paper discusses the constitutional implications of Brexit under Article 50 TEU, impacting legal, political, and policy domains. It examines the EU constitutional law framework and how it affects both the EU and the UK's political and legal structures (Pages 3-6, Section II).
The debate on the rights of citizens between the UK and EU influences human rights law, particularly the protection of rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (EUCFR) (Page 22, Section IV).
Example: This research impacts legal domains, guiding legal professionals and policymakers through the intricacies of Article 50 withdrawal, the Miller case, and the future interpretation of citizenship rights under EU law.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

The long-term impact is evident in shaping future legal interpretations of EU withdrawal agreements and the constitutional obligations of member states. The discussions around the constitutionalist reading are likely to have enduring influence on future EU legal frameworks and case law (Pages 10-11, Section III).
Example: This research will likely influence legal debates and policy reforms regarding EU member state withdrawals for years to come, particularly in future cases of political shifts within the Union.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

Stakeholders include legal professionals, EU policymakers, and constitutional scholars, who will use the findings to guide the interpretation and application of EU law in relation to withdrawal procedures and citizenship rights (Page 17, Section IV).
Example: Direct stakeholders are EU courts and governments, while indirect stakeholders include EU and UK citizens, whose rights are affected by the legal outcomes.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The paper offers a deep impact by focusing on the legal and constitutional complexities of Article 50, delving into detailed legal frameworks and procedural implications for EU governance (Pages 5-7).
Example: The deep impact is primarily within the legal field, influencing constitutional law experts, while its broad impact includes influencing policy discussions on national sovereignty and international treaties.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The findings are transferable to other international legal contexts, especially for future cases where countries withdraw from international unions or organizations. The principles discussed, such as respect for constitutional requirements and human rights, can be applied in other global contexts (Page 13).
Example: The research can inform the legal frameworks for sovereign withdrawals from global organizations beyond the EU.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The paper presents disruptive potential in proposing a constitutionalist reading of Article 50, challenging the political interpretations often favored by intergovernmental bodies. It suggests a shift towards a legalistic interpretation that may alter future negotiations (Pages 8-9).
Example: This disruption could influence EU constitutional negotiations, shifting power dynamics towards more legal accountability and less political expediency.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Ethical considerations are embedded in the discussion about maintaining human rights protections during and after Brexit, focusing on ensuring that neither side violates ECHR principles (Page 17, Section IV).
Example: The paper emphasizes the ethical importance of citizens' rights, ensuring that withdrawal agreements respect human dignity and freedoms.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The paper provides practical insights into how the constitutionalist framework can be implemented in ongoing and future withdrawal negotiations. It offers legal practitioners a blueprint for handling complex sovereignty issues in international law (Page 15).
Example: This research could be used by lawyers and policy advisers in shaping the legal processes for exit negotiations within the EU and other international entities.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research integrates perspectives from legal, political, and human rights disciplines, making it highly relevant for global discussions about sovereignty and international treaties (Page 14).
Example: It is relevant to both constitutional law and international relations, influencing global discussions on how nations manage withdrawals from unions or treaty-based organizations.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The constitutionalist reading offers a flexible framework that can be adapted to various political contexts, ensuring that future legal interpretations of Article 50 are resilient against political shifts (Page 11).
Example: The adaptability of this legal framework could be essential in future scenarios where nations seek to redefine their relationship with international unions, balancing political will with constitutional law.

This comprehensive assessment ensures that the research's potential impact on these dimensions is thoroughly examined and tied to its findings within the legal, constitutional, and human rights domains.
