Based on the review of the entire study on European Women's Video Art (EWVA) in the 1970s and 1980s, several potential research impacts can be identified across multiple dimensions. These impacts can be understood by aligning them with key research impact frameworks, which include academic, cultural, and societal dimensions. I will highlight as many impacts as possible, referencing the attached study and the research impact frameworks provided by your resources:

1. Cultural and Social Impact
Cultural Preservation: The study recovers and reassesses the contributions of women video artists from a historically significant period, ensuring their work is not lost to time. This effort promotes the preservation of cultural heritage, which is essential for future generations of scholars and the public​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Societal Change and Inclusivity: By spotlighting female artists who were marginalized in both academia and museum sectors, the study fosters a greater recognition of women's roles in art history. This contributes to greater inclusivity and equity in cultural recognition and historical representation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Academic Impact
Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress: The research contributes to the expansion of knowledge in art history, specifically in the underexplored area of women's contributions to video art. This fills critical gaps in the historical narrative and provides a foundation for future academic work in art, feminist studies, and digital media preservation​(impact pathway).
Deep Academic Engagement: The study has deep academic impact as it challenges existing scholarly paradigms and influences future research directions by expanding the discourse on the role of women in video art​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
3. Technological and Archival Impact
Technological Adoption and Cultural Digitization: By addressing the need to digitize and archive lost or inaccessible video works, the research has the potential to influence practices in digital archiving and media preservation. It provides a methodological framework for how to handle the conservation of ephemeral digital media​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Educational and Training Impact
Capacity Building and Educational Impact: The project can be integrated into university curricula in art history and media studies, promoting education about women’s contributions to video art and encouraging new generations of scholars and students to explore feminist perspectives in media arts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cross-Disciplinary Training: The study promotes cross-disciplinary education, as it integrates aspects of art history, media studies, feminism, and technology. This approach provides valuable training opportunities for students and researchers across these disciplines​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Cultural Policy and Advocacy Impact
Policy Influence and Advocacy: The study’s focus on the historical underrepresentation of women in art may inspire changes in cultural policy, particularly in how museums, galleries, and educational institutions recognize and promote women's contributions to art​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Advocacy for Equal Representation: The research indirectly advocates for the equal representation of women in historical narratives, particularly in the arts. This advocacy could influence cultural funding decisions and how future exhibitions are curated in art institutions​(impact pathway).
6. Public Awareness and Community Engagement
Public Engagement and Cultural Awareness: By making the contributions of early women video artists more visible, the research raises public awareness of gender biases in art history. It encourages greater public engagement with women's roles in the development of modern art, potentially influencing how future exhibitions are presented to broader audiences​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
7. Long-Term Sustainability Impact
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations: The emphasis on preserving lost works aligns with sustainability efforts in digital media preservation. Ensuring these historical video works are available for future generations supports the ethical commitment to cultural heritage and sustainable archival practices​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Behavioral and Attitudinal Change
Shifting Perceptions of Women's Contributions: The research has the potential to change societal attitudes towards the value of women’s artistic contributions. By bringing these marginalized works to light, it may influence how women’s historical roles in the arts are viewed and discussed in public and academic circles​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Innovation and Disruption in Art Historical Narratives
Disruption of Canonical Art Narratives: By focusing on previously neglected contributions, the research disrupts traditional narratives in art history. This disruptive potential could lead to a reevaluation of the canon of video art and how gender and artistic experimentation are framed in historical contexts​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Economic and Commercial Impact
Indirect Economic Impact: While primarily cultural, the research could have an economic impact through its influence on museum curation and exhibition strategies. Museums that incorporate these works into exhibitions may see financial benefits from increased public interest in underexplored aspects of video art history​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Resilience and Adaptability
Adaptation to Changing Technologies and Methods: The research demonstrates resilience and adaptability by addressing the challenges of archiving and preserving video art, which is particularly vulnerable due to the rapid obsolescence of media formats. The methods developed for this project could be applied to other art forms or disciplines facing similar technological challenges​(impact pathway).
12. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-Disciplinary Engagement: The research engages multiple disciplines, including media studies, feminist theory, and archival science. Its methodologies and findings can be applied globally to other contexts where women’s contributions to artistic and cultural movements may have been similarly marginalized​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
In conclusion, the EWVA study has a wide array of potential impacts, ranging from cultural preservation and academic knowledge advancement to public awareness, policy advocacy, and technological innovation. It is a valuable example of how research can cross multiple domains and create both immediate and long-lasting impacts.
