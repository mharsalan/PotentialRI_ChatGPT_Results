Based on the detailed reading of the study and the framework of research impact, I can provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential research impacts of the exhibition and digitization project focusing on The Water Hen (Exhibition): Kantor, Demarco, and the Edinburgh Festival, RSA, Edinburgh. These impacts align with the predefined dimensions from various impact assessment models, including academic, cultural, and societal impacts.

1. Cultural and Artistic Impact
The exhibition contributes significantly to cultural preservation by digitizing and showcasing previously unseen film footage of The Water Hen performance. This effort aids in:

Cultural Preservation and Heritage: The digitization process preserves a unique historical performance and makes it accessible to the public and future generations. It enhances understanding and appreciation of avant-garde theater, especially in the context of Eastern European art.
Artistic Impact: The exhibition highlights Tadeusz Kantor’s contributions to theater and visual arts, influencing modern curators, performance artists, and critics by providing new material that can shape future exhibitions and performances.
Community and Public Engagement: The exhibition opens a dialogue between Eastern European avant-garde art and Western European audiences, fostering cross-cultural appreciation and understanding.
2. Educational and Academic Impact
The exhibition provides new primary sources and research material for scholars in performance studies, art history, and Eastern European studies. The potential impacts in this area include:

Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress: By revealing new visual and contextual information about The Water Hen performance, the project contributes to the academic body of knowledge on Kantor’s work and the influence of Eastern European avant-garde theater on the global art scene.
Capacity Building and Training: The project offers educational opportunities for students and researchers by making the newly digitized material available for study and analysis, potentially becoming part of performance art curricula and art history courses.
Interdisciplinary Relevance: The digitization and sequencing of archival footage integrate fields like digital humanities, archival studies, and visual arts, providing a valuable resource for interdisciplinary research and teaching.
3. Societal and Public Engagement Impact
The exhibition has the potential to reach beyond academic circles and affect broader societal awareness and understanding of Eastern European culture. The societal impacts include:

Public Awareness and Education: The exhibition will likely stimulate public interest in Eastern European avant-garde movements, enhancing public knowledge of this cultural heritage through accessible exhibits and public screenings of the newly discovered footage.
Community Engagement and Participation: The collaboration with institutions like the Royal Scottish Academy and National Galleries of Scotland fosters public engagement, inviting local and international communities to participate in the cultural dialogue.
Behavioral Change: By offering new insights into Eastern European theater traditions, the exhibition may influence public perceptions and appreciation of historically marginalized or underrepresented art forms, potentially fostering greater cultural diversity in public programming and media.
4. Technological and Curatorial Impact
The technical aspects of the project, including the digitization of archival footage, create lasting impacts in the fields of digital curation and archival research:

Technological Advancement: The use of modern digitization techniques not only preserves fragile film materials but also sets a precedent for how archival footage of performances can be restored and made publicly available. This advances methodologies in digital humanities and archival research.
Scalability and Transferability: The techniques used to sequence photographs with the film can be applied to other archival collections, making the exhibition a model for future projects in museums and archival institutions worldwide.
5. Global and Cross-disciplinary Relevance
The international collaboration, including institutions in Poland, expands the global relevance of the exhibition:

International Collaboration and Diplomacy: The project strengthens cross-border cultural relations, particularly between Scotland and Poland, fostering international artistic exchanges and reinforcing global appreciation of shared cultural heritage.
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The project integrates performance art, digital archiving, and art history, making it relevant across multiple academic disciplines and cultural institutions.
6. Economic and Policy Impact
While the immediate economic impacts of the exhibition are subtle, they include:

Economic Impact and Return on Investment: The exhibition could attract new audiences to cultural institutions in Scotland, potentially boosting local tourism and associated industries. Furthermore, the digitization techniques developed during the project may offer cost-saving models for similar archival projects in the future.
Policy Influence and Advocacy: The project’s success in preserving and showcasing cultural heritage could inform policy decisions regarding funding for cultural preservation projects and the promotion of cross-cultural exhibitions at national and international levels.
7. Resilience and Sustainability
The preservation of this unique performance footage ensures its relevance for future generations:

Sustainability: By digitizing and preserving the only known complete film of The Water Hen, the project ensures that this cultural artifact will be available to future researchers, curators, and the public, aligning with long-term sustainability goals in cultural heritage preservation.
Resilience: The project adapts archival material into a digital format, ensuring that it remains accessible despite the degradation of the original film, showcasing the adaptability of performance art archiving in the digital age.
8. Innovation and Disruption
The project introduces innovative methodologies in archival research and performance studies:

Innovation and Disruption Potential: The digitization process and the creation of a definitive sequence of archival photographs disrupt traditional archival methods, offering new ways to reconstruct and present historical performances.
9. Implementation and Usability
The digitized materials have immediate applicability in academic and curatorial settings:

Implementation and Usability: The digitized footage and photographs can be used in academic research, public exhibitions, and educational curricula, making them highly usable across sectors.
Conclusion
This project’s impacts span multiple dimensions, influencing cultural preservation, academic research, public engagement, and technological advancement. Through innovative digitization, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and public outreach, the exhibition makes lasting contributions to Eastern European performance art’s global recognition and preservation.
