The study you uploaded provides significant potential research impacts across several dimensions, particularly in the context of cultural preservation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and societal contributions. Below, I have outlined the potential research impacts aligned with common impact dimensions based on the studyâ€™s content and relevant frameworks:

1. Cultural Preservation and Heritage Impact
Potential Impact: The study has a clear impact on the preservation of cultural heritage, especially by digitizing and archiving materials related to visual and performing arts. This ensures the long-term availability of culturally significant content from the 1960s to the 1990s for researchers, educators, and the public. This contributes to maintaining cultural memory and providing resources for future research and public engagement in cultural heritage. Example: The digital preservation of the Demarco archive supports understanding and appreciation of Scottish and European avant-garde art.

2. Public Awareness and Education Impact
Potential Impact: By making this archive accessible digitally, the research enhances public awareness and education about cultural history, art movements, and cross-cultural exchanges. It serves as an educational tool for schools, universities, and the general public to explore historical materials that were previously inaccessible. Example: The archive can be integrated into arts curricula, giving students direct access to primary resources for their studies in modern art, history, and cultural studies.

3. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Potential Impact: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance, influencing fields like art history, performance studies, and cultural anthropology. It also has global significance due to the international scope of the materials, which include records from both Eastern and Western Europe. Example: Researchers in multiple disciplines worldwide can benefit from the digitized materials, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of cross-cultural artistic interactions.

4. Capacity Building and Training
Potential Impact: The process of digitizing, curating, and archiving these materials provides opportunities for capacity building in the digital humanities. Students and professionals can be trained in digital archiving techniques, metadata creation, and the use of digital tools in historical research. Example: Internships or training programs related to the digitization project would help develop skills in digital preservation, making students more competitive in the job market.

5. Technological Advancement and Innovation
Potential Impact: The use of digital technology to preserve and make accessible historical documents and artifacts is an innovation in the field of cultural preservation. The study potentially contributes to advancements in digital archiving techniques and the usability of digital platforms for academic research. Example: The digital archive's interface and search functionality can set a precedent for similar projects, driving further innovation in the field of digital humanities.

6. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Potential Impact: The study promotes the sustainability of cultural artifacts by reducing the need for physical handling, which can degrade the original materials. Additionally, the ethical consideration of making cultural history accessible to a global audience aligns with inclusivity and equity goals. Example: By ensuring that the archive is freely available to users globally, the project supports equitable access to cultural resources, regardless of geographical location or financial constraints.

7. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Potential Impact: The archive supports ongoing knowledge accumulation by providing future researchers with access to unique primary sources. This resource can lead to new discoveries and further academic progress in understanding the cultural and artistic movements of the 20th century. Example: Future studies may rely on these primary sources to develop new interpretations of European avant-garde art, influencing subsequent scholarship.

8. Social and Cultural Impact
Potential Impact: The digitization of the Demarco archive can influence societal norms and cultural practices by raising awareness of the importance of cultural exchange and historical preservation. It also supports efforts to document and celebrate marginalized voices in art and performance, contributing to a more inclusive historical narrative. Example: Exhibitions and public outreach programs that utilize the digital archive could encourage greater public engagement with the arts, particularly among younger generations unfamiliar with these historical movements.

9. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Potential Impact: The project disrupts traditional modes of accessing and engaging with cultural archives by democratizing access to rare and significant historical materials. This opens up new possibilities for research and public engagement, as people no longer need to visit physical archives. Example: The model of creating a fully digitized, searchable, and publicly accessible archive can be replicated for other collections, disrupting how archival research is conducted globally.

10. Intellectual Property Generation
Potential Impact: While not immediately commercial, the creation of a digital archive may lead to intellectual property opportunities related to the platform or the methods used for digitization and metadata structuring. Example: Licensing agreements could be developed for the use of the digital platform or tools created as part of the project, benefiting other institutions looking to digitize their own collections.

11. Implementation and Usability
Potential Impact: The study emphasizes practical usability by creating a user-friendly digital platform that researchers, educators, and the public can easily navigate. This maximizes the impact by ensuring that the resource is accessible to a broad audience. Example: The platform could serve as a model for other archival projects seeking to make their collections more accessible and usable by a global audience.

12. Behavioral Change
Potential Impact: The study could influence behaviors among institutions and individuals by highlighting the importance of digital preservation. Other cultural institutions may adopt similar digital strategies, leading to broader changes in how cultural heritage is preserved and accessed. Example: Museums and galleries may be inspired to digitize their collections, increasing public access and participation in the cultural sector.

By aligning the outcomes of this study with these research impact dimensions, it is clear that the project not only preserves cultural heritage but also contributes to academic progress, social engagement, and technological innovation.
