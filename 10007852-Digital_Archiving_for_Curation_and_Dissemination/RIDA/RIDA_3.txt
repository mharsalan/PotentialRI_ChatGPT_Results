I have reviewed the research paper you uploaded and will now assess it across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" using the guidelines provided. Below are the dimensions and their relevance to the study on European Women's Video Art (EWVA) in the 70s and 80s:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "EWVA aims to recover and reassess the seminal contribution of women artists to early video art in Europe and more generally to the development and evolution of video as a then relatively new medium" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research impacts the Cultural and Artistic Domain by preserving and reassessing the contributions of women video artists, which influences how their work is represented in museums and academic discourse. It also impacts Academic and Cultural Heritage preservation by filling gaps in the digital archiving of their work.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Many women artists’ video works are today lost or have not yet been migrated to digital archival formats" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research has long-term impact as it contributes to the preservation of video art for future generations, ensuring the historical contributions of these women are recognized and influencing ongoing archival practices in both academic and museum settings.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "This gap is evident both in academia and in the museum sector, and more generally within contemporary culture" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: Direct stakeholders include academic researchers in the fields of contemporary art and video media, as well as curators in museums who are responsible for preserving video art. Indirect stakeholders include the public, who benefit from an enriched understanding of early video art and its historical significance.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Several women artists’ fundamental and pioneering experiments remain under-researched and neither accessible nor critical writing upon them published" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research has deep impact within the Art History field by highlighting under-researched contributions, potentially influencing future academic inquiries. It also has broad impact across cultural sectors, affecting museums, educational curricula, and contemporary feminist discourse in the arts.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "Several women artists’ video works are today lost or have not yet been migrated to digital archival formats" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research can be scaled by applying its findings to other geographical regions or art movements where women's contributions may also be underrepresented. The project is also transferable across different types of archival work, influencing the preservation of digital media beyond video art.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "EWVA aims to recover and reassess the seminal contribution of women artists to early video art in Europe" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: This research is innovative in its focus on recovering neglected contributions of women in video art, which is disruptive to the traditional art historical canon that has marginalized these works. It challenges the way video art history has been written and archived, thereby reshaping the narrative.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "Their contribution to video art is still marginalised and has partially fallen into oblivion" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research promotes sustainability by ensuring that video artworks are preserved for future generations. It also engages in ethical considerations by addressing the marginalization of women’s contributions in art history, advocating for equity and inclusivity in the representation of artistic achievements.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "Aims to recover and reassess... video as a then relatively new medium" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The usability of this research lies in its practical application for museums and academic institutions that manage digital archives. The study’s findings can be implemented in the creation of more inclusive archival practices and curatorial approaches that recognize and preserve the contributions of women artists.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "Aims to recover and reassess the seminal contribution of women artists to early video art in Europe" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by engaging with art history, feminist studies, and archival science. Its global relevance is seen in its potential to influence how women's contributions to art and culture are recognized globally, particularly in regions where similar archival gaps exist.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "Neither accessible nor critical writing upon them published" (Abstract, Page 72).
Example: The research is resilient because it seeks to re-establish the significance of lost or under-researched works, ensuring that these contributions are not forgotten. It is also adaptable as it applies to a broad range of archival contexts, including future technologies that may further change how video art is preserved.
These dimensions highlight the multifaceted impact of the research on preserving and reassessing the contributions of European women video artists from the 1970s and 80s, influencing not only art history but also broader cultural, academic, and archival practices.
