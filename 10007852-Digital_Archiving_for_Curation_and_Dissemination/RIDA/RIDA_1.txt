To assess the research impact dimensions for the exhibition titled "The Water Hen (Exhibition): Kantor, Demarco, and the Edinburgh Festival, RSA, Edinburgh," I will refer to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact based on the provided framework.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
The exhibition centers on the discovery and display of a newly digitized and previously unseen film of The Water Hen, a performance by Kantor in 1972, along with additional archival materials such as photographs and interviews. This contributes to several domains:

Cultural and Artistic Domain: "The RSA will premiere the aforementioned film ... increasing critical understanding of the production from multiple viewpoints" (p. 72).
Educational Domain: The research uncovers new historical and visual information, thus enriching art and performance studies.
Academic Domain: The project informs the study of Eastern European performance art, particularly Kantor's influence on international theater.

Example:
This exhibition enhances the understanding of Kantor’s influence on avant-garde theater, promoting further scholarly research in art history, cultural preservation, and performance studies. It also impacts curatorial practices by providing new archival footage, supporting a deeper exploration of visual arts and theater.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
The film of The Water Hen performance is described as the only complete recording of its kind, offering significant long-term contributions to the academic study of Kantor's work and 20th-century performance art. "This is the only film of the entire 'The Water Hen' performance in existence, and so there is already great interest in news of the discovery of this film."

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
This exhibition will have a lasting impact on academic studies of Eastern European theater and avant-garde movements by offering unique archival material that will continue to serve as a critical resource for future research and exhibitions.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:
Stakeholders include academic researchers, curators, cultural institutions, and the public. The exhibition involves collaboration between institutions like the University of Dundee, National Galleries of Scotland, and the Royal Scottish Academy, ensuring that the project reaches diverse stakeholders in the cultural and academic sectors.

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
Direct stakeholders include curators and art historians who benefit from new archival materials, while indirect stakeholders such as the general public gain access to previously unavailable cultural performances, enhancing cultural appreciation and education.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
The project deeply impacts the field of performance studies by revealing previously unseen footage of a seminal avant-garde work. It also has broad implications across visual arts, curatorial practices, and international cultural collaborations. "Researchers ... uncovered a hitherto unknown film (of exceptional quality) of an entire performance of 'THE WATER HEN'."

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
The depth of the impact lies in advancing Kantor studies, while the breadth expands into cross-cultural collaborations, promoting global interest in Eastern European avant-garde performance and influencing museum curation practices.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
The discovery and digitization of archival materials set a precedent for future projects involving the digitization of historical performances. "The film has allowed researchers to definitively sequence still photographs taken by Demarco and George Oliver."

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
The digitization process can be scaled to preserve other performances, while the methodology of archival sequencing is transferable to other curatorial projects, making it possible to digitize and analyze historical performances globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
This project is innovative in how it integrates new digital technologies to sequence photographs and performance footage, contributing to a deeper understanding of a historically significant work. "The newly digitized film...allowed researchers to definitively sequence still photographs... increasing critical understanding."

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
The discovery and use of digital tools to restore and sequence archival performance footage disrupt traditional archival methods and open new avenues for the study of historical performance art.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
The project adheres to sustainable practices by preserving and making available archival materials that would otherwise have been lost. This aligns with cultural sustainability efforts, ensuring that important performance works are accessible to future generations.

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
By digitizing fragile film materials, the project ensures the long-term preservation of cultural heritage, addressing ethical concerns of accessibility and preservation of historical art for future research and public viewing.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
The digitized materials can be used by art historians, educators, and institutions globally. The presentation includes documentation from performances, which can be integrated into museum exhibits, academic courses, and public screenings.

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
The usability of these materials extends beyond the exhibition, offering educational institutions resources for teaching Kantor's work and enabling other cultural institutions to implement similar archival projects.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
This research connects performance studies, visual arts, and digital humanities, making it relevant across multiple disciplines. It also engages international stakeholders, such as the Adam Mickiewicz Institute (Warsaw) and Cricoteka (Krakow), broadening its global impact.

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
The global relevance of the exhibition is seen in its international collaborations, highlighting Kantor’s global legacy and influence on modern theater, while the cross-disciplinary nature of the research combines technology, archival work, and art history.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
The project demonstrates resilience by adapting archival materials to modern technology. The rediscovery of forgotten performance footage and its integration into contemporary exhibitions show adaptability to new media and curatorial practices.

Page Reference and Section: Abstract, page 72.

Example:
By digitizing previously inaccessible archival materials, the exhibition adapts historical performance into a format that can engage contemporary audiences, ensuring the work remains relevant in the digital age.

This analysis captures the research's contributions across various impact dimensions, ensuring its broader relevance to cultural, academic, and global contexts.
