Here is an overview of the research impact dimensions for the uploaded study based on the predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The paper assesses the UK's foreign, security, and defence policy post-Brexit, with a focus on the UK’s relationship with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). It highlights potential impacts in multiple domains:
Policy Domain: "Exiting the EU's CFSP would appear to carry more significant costs for the UK...this could affect UK’s influence on collective EU decisions on foreign and security policies" (p. 47-48).
Academic Domain: The analysis offers insights into the geopolitical dynamics between the UK and EU, enriching academic discourse in political science and international relations.
Page Reference: Results, pages 47-48.
Example: The study directly informs public and governmental policy regarding the UK's future role in international security, helping shape both national and international foreign policy decisions.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research discusses both short-term and long-term implications of the UK's departure from the EU's defense and foreign policies:
Short-term Impact: "The immediate impact for the UK is diminished capacity for shaping EU defense policies...this loss of influence may manifest rapidly in foreign policy decisions" (p. 45).
Long-term Impact: "In the long term, Brexit could force the UK to rethink its position in global diplomacy...which may take years to manifest as new relationships are built" (p. 49).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 45, 49.
Example: Short-term impacts include a reduced influence on EU policy, while the long-term impacts may reshape the UK's entire diplomatic approach over the next decades, affecting future global alliances.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study impacts a wide range of stakeholders:
Direct Stakeholders: Policymakers in the UK and EU who will need to navigate new security policies post-Brexit (p. 43).
Indirect Stakeholders: Broader European and global actors who will be affected by changes in UK-EU security dynamics (p. 44).
Page Reference: Results, pages 43-44.
Example: Policymakers and governmental bodies in the UK and EU are primary stakeholders. The public and defense contractors are indirect beneficiaries of improved policies ensuring national security.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The paper provides a deep analysis of the UK's foreign policy but also has broad implications:
Deep Impact: Detailed focus on the UK's defense policy transformation post-Brexit (p. 46).
Broad Impact: The analysis crosses disciplinary boundaries, impacting both defense policy and international relations theory (p. 48).
Page Reference: Results, pages 46, 48.
Example: Deep impact on the specific field of defense studies, while also influencing broader discussions in international diplomacy and European security frameworks.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research findings could be applied to other regions or countries facing similar geopolitical transitions:
Scalability: "The conclusions on defense strategy could be applied to other nations reassessing their alliances in the wake of political shifts" (p. 47).
Transferability: The framework used to evaluate post-Brexit UK security could be applied to other global geopolitical shifts, such as the disintegration of multinational unions (p. 49).
Page Reference: Discussion, pages 47, 49.
Example: The research model developed for evaluating UK-EU defense policy can be scaled to assess global defense strategies or transferred to similar geopolitical separations globally.
This analysis shows how the study impacts different research dimensions across policy, academic, and global security fields.
