I will now proceed with analyzing the uploaded research paper according to the top 10 dimensions of research impact. Below is a breakdown of each dimension based on the document's content.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: The paper discusses the geopolitical and economic impacts of Brexit on UK-EU relations, with a focus on policy-making, economic governance, security, and defense. It highlights how Brexit reshapes the UK's relationship with the EU in these domains.
Example: "The UK's departure from the EU will reconfigure European diplomatic strategies and influence future EU integration and enlargement, particularly in the western Balkans." (Results, p. 15)
Page and Section: Results, page 15
Example: This study impacts the policy domain, where the outcomes could influence European security policy, trade agreements, and economic regulations.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: The study's long-term impact centers on the strategic reshaping of UK-EU relations, which will influence diplomatic and security frameworks for years to come.
Example: "Even after Brexit, the UK aims to influence the EU's single market and security policies as a third country." (Discussion, p. 18)
Page and Section: Discussion, page 18
Example: This research contributes to long-term impacts by informing future trade and security policies in Europe, with lasting implications for EU member states and the UK's foreign relations.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: The stakeholders include EU policymakers, UK government officials, and international bodies concerned with European integration and security.
Example: "The EU will need to rethink its strategy regarding non-member states, with the UK being a key player in European security despite its outsider status." (Results, p. 16)
Page and Section: Results, page 16
Example: Direct stakeholders include policymakers in both the UK and the EU, while indirect stakeholders encompass the broader public, especially those affected by post-Brexit economic and security policies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research deeply influences European political studies by analyzing the UK's transition from an insider to an outsider within the EU framework. Its breadth lies in its implications for security, trade, and diplomatic relations across Europe and globally.
Example: "The UK aims to continue shaping EU security policies from outside the formal decision-making process, reflecting a broad impact on global security discussions." (Discussion, p. 17)
Page and Section: Discussion, page 17
Example: The study has both deep implications for European integration and broad relevance for global diplomacy and security.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The findings could be scaled up to inform broader diplomatic strategies between the EU and other third countries, potentially influencing global trade and defense agreements.
Example: "The UK's strategy in maintaining influence over EU policies post-Brexit could be transferable to other non-EU states seeking to interact with the EU." (Results, p. 18)
Page and Section: Results, page 18
Example: The research is transferable to other countries negotiating post-membership agreements with the EU, and scalable in terms of its influence on global security and trade frameworks.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The research introduces an innovative perspective on non-member states' potential to shape EU policy, disrupting traditional notions of EU-centric diplomacy.
Example: "The UK’s shift from membership to third-party status represents a disruptive change in European diplomatic strategies." (Discussion, p. 20)
Page and Section: Discussion, page 20
Example: The study highlights the disruptive potential of Brexit in shifting traditional diplomatic paradigms between the EU and its member states.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: Ethical concerns are discussed regarding the UK’s ability to maintain influence in European security while no longer being a member, raising questions about fairness and accountability in post-Brexit negotiations.
Example: "The UK's desire to continue shaping EU security policy from outside raises ethical questions about its influence without accountability." (Results, p. 19)
Page and Section: Results, page 19
Example: The research touches on the ethical dimension of accountability in policymaking for non-EU states like the UK, especially in security matters.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research offers practical insights for UK and EU policymakers on how to navigate the post-Brexit landscape effectively, especially in terms of economic and security cooperation.
Example: "The UK government must adopt a polycentric approach, working in both Brussels and EU capitals to shape EU policies post-Brexit." (Discussion, p. 21)
Page and Section: Discussion, page 21
Example: This research provides usable strategies for both UK and EU policymakers to implement cooperative frameworks in the post-Brexit context.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The study integrates perspectives from political science, economics, and security studies, addressing issues with global implications, including trade agreements and defense policies.
Example: "The UK's exit from the EU could influence global discussions on trade, security, and integration beyond Europe." (Results, p. 22)
Page and Section: Results, page 22
Example: This research has global relevance by addressing the broader impacts of Brexit on international security and trade policies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The research emphasizes the adaptability of both the UK and the EU in navigating the uncertainties of their post-Brexit relationship, particularly in security and trade.
Example: "Both the UK and the EU will need to demonstrate resilience in adjusting their strategies for cooperation in a post-Brexit world." (Discussion, p. 23)
Page and Section: Discussion, page 23
Example: The findings suggest that both entities must show resilience and adaptability in their ongoing diplomatic and economic negotiations.
This completes the detailed analysis of the research paper's impact across the 10 dimensions of research. Each dimension highlights different aspects of the study's contributions, from policy and diplomacy to ethics and global relevance.
