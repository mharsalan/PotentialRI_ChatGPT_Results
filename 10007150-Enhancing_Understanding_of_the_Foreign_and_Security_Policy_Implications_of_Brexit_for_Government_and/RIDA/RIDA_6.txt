I have reviewed the paper you uploaded, and based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The paper emphasizes the potential impact of Brexit on the UK's foreign policy, defense, and its relationship with international organizations like NATO and the EU, specifically mentioning a recalibration of bilateral relationships with Europe and the US (Page 2, Epilogue).
Example: This research contributes to the domain of international relations and security studies by providing insights into the strategic shifts required in post-Brexit UK foreign policy.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The paper notes that the consequences of Brexit on UK defense policy are unprecedented, making it difficult to predict the long-term impacts, with Brexit negotiations expected to take at least two years and potentially a decade (Page 2, Epilogue).
Example: This research has long-term implications as it lays the foundation for future studies on the evolving nature of UK foreign policy and its impact on European security.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The paper identifies key stakeholders, such as EU member states, NATO, the US, and the UK, whose security policies and defense strategies will be affected by Brexit (Page 3, Epilogue).
Example: Policymakers in both the UK and EU are primary stakeholders, as the findings provide guidance for negotiating defense collaborations and shaping post-Brexit security frameworks.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research highlights the broad geopolitical consequences of Brexit, affecting both UK-EU and UK-US relations, with implications for NATO and international security alliances (Page 3, Epilogue).
Example: This research has both deep and broad impact, influencing policy decisions in international relations, defense strategies, and European security frameworks.
5. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The paper suggests that post-Brexit, the UK's security and defense policies will need to align with economic realities, particularly with the potential for reduced defense spending (Page 4, Epilogue).
Example: This research encourages sustainable defense policies by considering the economic constraints that might affect the UK's ability to maintain its defense commitments.
6. Usability:
Excerpt: The research discusses the need for recalibrating security relationships post-Brexit, which can provide actionable insights for policymakers in both the UK and the EU as they navigate the transition (Page 2, Epilogue).
Example: The findings are directly usable by governmental bodies in developing strategic defense partnerships and addressing bilateral security issues post-Brexit.
7. Implementation:
Excerpt: The UK's future role in European security and its bilateral relationships with EU member states and the US will require new strategic frameworks (Page 3, Epilogue).
Example: The research can be implemented by defense ministries and international organizations like NATO to adjust policies and frameworks for post-Brexit defense cooperation.
8. Disruption:
Excerpt: The paper suggests that Brexit disrupts the existing security framework, especially the UKâ€™s role within the EU and its defense collaborations with NATO (Page 2, Epilogue).
Example: This research provides a disruptive analysis of how Brexit challenges the established security structures, potentially leading to new defense alignments and strategies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The paper draws on political science, defense studies, and international relations to analyze the wide-reaching impacts of Brexit on European and global security (Page 3, Epilogue).
Example: This research is cross-disciplinary and globally relevant, influencing not only the field of international relations but also defense policy and global security frameworks.
10. Innovation:
Excerpt: The research presents innovative approaches to understanding how the UK's foreign and security policies will evolve outside the EU, considering new partnerships and alliances (Page 4, Epilogue).
Example: The study innovatively reimagines post-Brexit defense strategies, offering new perspectives on UK security collaborations with non-EU states and international organizations.
This detailed breakdown highlights the research's multifaceted impacts, with clear implications for stakeholders, including policymakers, defense institutions, and international organizations.
