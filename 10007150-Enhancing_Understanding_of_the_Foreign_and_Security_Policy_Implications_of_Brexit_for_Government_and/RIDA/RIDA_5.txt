Here’s an assessment of the research impact dimensions based on the text of the article "Brexit or Bremain: what future for the UK’s European diplomatic strategy?" by Richard G. Whitman (2016), analyzed according to the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact":

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts:
"The UK has consistently pursued four interconnected strategic goals with respect to the EU... to deepen the EU’s single market as a liberalization and deregulation project, open as widely as possible to the free trade agenda..." (Results, p. 511).
"The decision to hold a referendum... introduces uncertainty into the 50-year-old strategy... to structure its political and economic engagement with Europe..." (Introduction, p. 509).
Example:
This research has a significant policy impact, influencing UK foreign policy towards Europe, and offers academic insights into political strategies related to European diplomacy. It also informs economic strategies regarding trade, deregulation, and market participation.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts:
"A UK exit would add a new problem... The UK has not confronted a more uncertain environment within which to pursue a European strategy since the end of the Second World War" (Discussion, p. 510).
"The various strands of the UK’s extra-European diplomatic strategy were mapped and summarized during the Review of the Balance of Competences exercise undertaken during the term of the 2010–2015 coalition government" (p. 512).
Example:
This research demonstrates long-term impact by discussing diplomatic strategies that could influence UK foreign relations and policy in the future. The review of competencies could remain relevant for many years to come, shaping how the UK engages with the EU and broader international diplomacy.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:

Excerpts:
"Cameron’s decision to hold a referendum on the UK’s continued membership of the EU... [was] driven by domestic political significance" (Discussion, p. 518).
Example:
Direct stakeholders include UK policymakers and European diplomats who use this analysis to inform decisions on Brexit. Indirect stakeholders are UK citizens, businesses, and the international community, all impacted by the geopolitical and economic consequences of UK diplomacy and its future role within or outside the EU.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts:
"The referendum demonstrates the most profound shift in the UK’s European diplomatic strategy" (p. 518).
"Britain’s foreign and security policy has been towards heightened international leadership and activism" (p. 513).
Example:
This research has a broad impact across multiple domains, influencing the fields of foreign policy, economics, and diplomacy. It also has a deep impact within the political sphere, as it explores specific shifts in UK diplomacy that could redefine how Britain engages with Europe for decades to come.
5. Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts:
"The UK’s intra-European strategy provides significant efficiencies... facilitating the resolution of interstate disagreements, and collective policies" (p. 512).
"Cameron’s decision to recalibrate Britain’s place in the world to ‘decentre’ the EU in the UK’s foreign policy" (p. 516).
Example:
The strategic framework provided by this research could be scalable, informing not just UK-EU relations, but how countries worldwide recalibrate their foreign policies during periods of economic and political upheaval. The model of transferability applies to other countries assessing membership in international unions (e.g., Norway or Switzerland's non-EU models).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts:
"The EU’s place in the UK’s European diplomatic strategy has evolved since the end of the Cold War" (p. 511).
Example:
The research’s disruptive potential lies in its analysis of Brexit as a political event that could fundamentally reshape the diplomatic and economic landscape of Europe. It proposes new approaches to diplomacy and international relations, offering innovative ways for Britain to navigate post-Brexit challenges.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts:
"The UK’s European diplomatic strategy... leveraging and amplifying broader national foreign and security policy objectives" (p. 511).
Example:
While the paper does not focus on environmental sustainability, it raises questions about the ethical implications of national sovereignty versus collective European cooperation. The sustainability of diplomatic and trade relationships post-Brexit is a central theme, with long-term ethical considerations regarding international governance.
8. Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts:
"The UK has demonstrated a preference for ‘promiscuous bilateralism’ within the EU, working with shifting coalitions" (p. 511).
Example:
This research can be implemented by policymakers as they reconfigure the UK’s foreign relations and trade policies. It is usable in shaping ongoing political negotiations, both in the Brexit process and for future diplomatic strategies outside the EU framework.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts:
"Britain is a ‘networked’ foreign policy actor for which the EU is only one network of influence" (p. 516).
Example:
The research is globally relevant and cross-disciplinary, as it covers areas of economics, international relations, and political strategy, influencing global diplomacy and providing insights for international stakeholders concerned with economic unions and sovereignty.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts:
"The instruments of the UK’s European strategy involve intra- and extra-European diplomacy" (p. 512).
Example:
This research highlights the adaptive strategies the UK might employ in its post-Brexit diplomacy, showcasing the resilience of British foreign policy and how it might evolve to maintain its influence on the global stage despite changing circumstances.
This detailed analysis captures the research impact dimensions as applied to the article. Each dimension underscores how the paper contributes to various fields, stakeholders, and potential long-term impacts in policy and diplomacy.
