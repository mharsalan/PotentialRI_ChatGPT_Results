5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The policy recommendations and insights could be scaled to other nations negotiating trade and defense partnerships with the EU, especially non-EU countries like Norway and Switzerland.
Transferability: The study’s framework for analyzing geopolitical impacts is transferable to other international contexts, such as trade and security negotiations between the US and its trade partners post-NAFTA.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The research introduces innovative approaches to understanding the role of a third country (the UK) in influencing EU policies post-membership, which could disrupt traditional diplomatic and economic relations between the EU and external partners.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research is relevant across multiple disciplines—economics, law, political science, and security studies—and has global implications, particularly for international relations and global trade policies.
The findings can inform similar geopolitical studies, particularly regarding countries undergoing secession or economic reconfigurations (e.g., Catalonia or Scotland).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study demonstrates resilience in analyzing the evolving dynamics of UK-EU relations post-Brexit. Its adaptability lies in its ability to inform policy adjustments as new trade, security, and diplomatic challenges arise.

In conclusion, this study holds significant potential for influencing a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from academics and policymakers to the general public, while addressing key domains such as economic and policy impacts. It is also likely to have both immediate and long-term impacts on UK-EU relations and offers valuable frameworks for international studies on geopolitical shifts.
