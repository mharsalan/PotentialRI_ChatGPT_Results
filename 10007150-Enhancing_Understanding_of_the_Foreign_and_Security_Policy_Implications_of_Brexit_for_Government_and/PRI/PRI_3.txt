Based on a detailed review of the study, here are the potential research impacts aligned with the predefined dimensions and supported by relevant examples from the study.

1. Domains of Research Impact (Academic, Policy, Social)
Policy Domain: The study evaluates the UK's foreign and security policy post-Brexit, providing crucial insights that could inform decision-makers in government about future defense and security strategies. For instance, recommendations for continued collaboration with the EU despite formal separation could influence UK defense and diplomatic policies.
Academic Domain: The study contributes significantly to the field of international relations and political science by offering a new perspective on the impacts of Brexit on national security and defense policies.
Social Domain: There is a broader societal relevance as the research addresses public safety concerns related to security and defense, with potential to shape public opinion on UK-EU relations post-Brexit​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
2. Duration of Research Impact (Short-Term and Long-Term)
Short-term Impact: Immediately after Brexit, the study’s insights into the rapid decline in UK's influence on European security decisions could inform immediate policy adjustments to mitigate risks.
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research could shape the UK's broader foreign policy, potentially influencing long-term diplomatic strategies and defense policies as the UK redefines its role globally post-Brexit​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
3. Stakeholder Impact (Direct and Indirect)
Direct Stakeholders: Government agencies, defense policymakers, and diplomatic entities are the primary stakeholders who can directly benefit from the study’s findings by using them to develop more informed strategies for post-Brexit security.
Indirect Stakeholders: The general public and businesses involved in defense industries could indirectly benefit through enhanced security measures and potentially more stable international relations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact (Deep and Broad)
Deep Impact: The study provides an in-depth analysis of the UK's foreign policy, especially related to defense, which could significantly alter academic and professional discussions about national security post-Brexit.
Broad Impact: Its implications are not limited to academia but extend into broader international relations, European security frameworks, and even economic stability as it explores the intersection of policy and global diplomacy​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study’s framework for evaluating defense policies in a post-EU context could be scaled to other geopolitical separations or reorganizations, such as future regional political shifts or country alliances.
Transferability: The conceptual models and insights could be applied to other countries reassessing their security policies in light of political changes (e.g., other countries considering leaving the EU)​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The study introduces innovative ideas about how non-EU countries can still influence EU security policies, offering new methodologies for defense strategy post-separation. While not entirely disruptive, it could change how post-EU UK operates in defense and security circles, fostering innovation in diplomatic negotiations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: By encouraging sustainable international security relations, especially between the UK and EU post-Brexit, the study contributes to a long-term vision of European stability and cooperation, which is critical in a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape.
Ethical Considerations: The study emphasizes maintaining ethical defense practices and promotes collaboration that benefits broader global security without undermining national sovereignty​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
The research offers practical policy recommendations that can be implemented by UK policymakers in defense and security. It suggests strategies that are readily actionable, such as negotiating special defense agreements with the EU or NATO​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The study’s analysis of defense, diplomacy, and post-Brexit foreign policy cuts across disciplines such as political science, international law, and defense studies, making it globally relevant. Its findings are pertinent not only to European countries but to any nation involved in global security networks​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Public Awareness and Education
Through public dissemination and educational outreach, the study could raise awareness among citizens about the practical implications of Brexit on security, influencing public opinion and fostering informed debate on the subject​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
The research implicitly addresses issues of inclusivity by analyzing the need for collective security and defense agreements that do not disproportionately benefit or disadvantage smaller nations, ensuring that all actors in the international community are treated equitably post-Brexit​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
12. Risk Reduction and Safety Improvement
By providing policymakers with data on how to mitigate the risks associated with being outside the EU's security framework, the study could help reduce risks related to national defense and improve the overall safety of UK citizens​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
These impacts illustrate how the research from the study not only advances academic knowledge but also holds significant policy and societal value.
