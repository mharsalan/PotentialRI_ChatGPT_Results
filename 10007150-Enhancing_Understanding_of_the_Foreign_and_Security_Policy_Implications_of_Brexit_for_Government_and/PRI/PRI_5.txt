5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: While the study focuses on the UK, its strategic frameworks for navigating international relations can be scaled and applied to other nations considering exits from regional unions or seeking to recalibrate their diplomatic strategies.
Transferability: The insights could be transferred to other global contexts where countries are reconsidering their relationships with multinational organizations, making the research relevant for countries like Switzerland or Norway in their non-EU negotiations.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The research introduces innovative ideas for post-Brexit diplomacy, particularly the concept of ‘promiscuous bilateralism’—a strategy that could be adopted by the UK to maintain influence through dynamic, flexible alliances.
Disruption: The study’s focus on how Brexit could disrupt the traditional framework of UK-EU relations offers new disruptive insights into international relations, changing long-held assumptions about how European diplomacy operates.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study touches on the sustainability of diplomatic and trade relations, particularly in how the UK can maintain long-term, stable relationships with both EU and non-EU countries post-Brexit.
Ethical Considerations: It raises questions about the ethical implications of national sovereignty versus collective cooperation, especially in the context of immigration, trade, and labor movement policies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability for Policymakers: The study provides concrete, implementable strategies for UK policymakers and diplomats as they navigate complex post-Brexit negotiations.
Practical Application: By analyzing real-world diplomatic strategies, the research is highly applicable for practitioners in foreign policy, making it usable for designing and adapting foreign relations policies.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary: The research brings together insights from political science, economics, and legal studies, making it relevant for scholars and professionals across these fields.
Global Relevance: The study’s examination of Brexit offers lessons for other regions, particularly in understanding how supranational organizations and their member states interact. Its insights are applicable beyond Europe, offering valuable lessons for other global diplomatic negotiations.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The research provides strategies that ensure the UK’s diplomatic efforts can remain resilient in the face of significant political shifts caused by Brexit.
Adaptability: The suggested diplomatic approaches, like forming shifting coalitions, show adaptability to new global challenges, ensuring the UK can continue to influence European policies despite no longer being a member of the EU.

12. Economic Impact
Economic Influence: Through its analysis of trade policies and market access, the study could influence economic strategies, potentially leading to new agreements that foster economic stability and growth in the UK post-Brexit.
13. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Advancement of Diplomatic Studies: The research contributes to the broader field of diplomatic studies by providing new frameworks for understanding and navigating supranational relationships and international cooperation.
These potential research impacts underscore the multifaceted nature of the study, highlighting its influence across academic, policy, economic, and societal domains.
