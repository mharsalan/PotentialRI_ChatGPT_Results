
Based on the study titled “Evaluation of a pilot police-led suicide early alert surveillance strategy in the United Kingdom,” the following are the Research Impact Dimensions that align with its content and findings:

1. Domains of Research Impact
This dimension addresses the areas where the research has significant influence:

Public Health Domain: The research provides critical insight into suicide prevention by exploring a police-led early alert strategy aimed at reducing the psychological impact on those bereaved by suicide. By expediting referrals to support services, the study contributes to improving the mental health and well-being of suicide survivors​(4 (5))iminal Justice Domain**: The police-led strategy represents an intersection of public health and law enforcement, introducing an innovative approach where the police play an active role in suicide postvention. This can influence future collaborations between health and justice sectors in mental health crises【157†source​(4 (5)) 2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact: The police-led strategy accelerates the referral process, reducing the time between a suicide and access to postvention support services. This immediate impact is crucial for reducing the mental health toll on the bereaved【157†source​(4 (5))ng-Term Impact**: The strategy has the potential to create long-lasting changes in suicide prevention policies, particularly by embedding police-led early alert systems within standard police operations. This could influence broader national suicide prevention strategies .
##holders of Research Impact**

Direct Stakeholders: The bereaved individuals who are offered timely access to support services are the primary beneficiaries. The study highlights the importance of providing quick postvention support to reduce long-term psychological harm【157†source】.

I​(4 (5))eholders: Public health officials, law enforcement agencies, and mental health organizations benefit indirectly by receiving data and insights that can enhance their approach to suicide prevention and postvention【157†source】.

##​(4 (5)) and Breadth of Impact**

Depth of Impact: The study has a deep impact on suicide postvention services, as it identifies the gaps in current support systems and proposes a solution that shortens the gap between a suicide and the bereavement support offered to survivors【157†source】.

B​(4 (5))pact: The research findings could be applied to other regions and contexts, promoting a multi-agency approach to suicide prevention that involves both law enforcement and public health sectors. This model is replicable and could be scaled to other jurisdictions .

5. ScalTransferability
Scalability: The police-led early alert strategy is highly scalable. The model can be expanded to other areas in the UK and adapted to countries with similar public health and law enforcement infrastructures. With the right resources, it can be integrated into national suicide prevention programs【157†source】.

**Transferabil​(4 (5))tudy’s findings are transferable to other public health challenges that require rapid, multi-agency responses. The principles of collaboration between police and health services can be applied to other crisis interventions, such as responding to domestic violence or drug overdoses【157†source】.

6. Inno​(4 (5))isruption Potential
Innovation: The police-led early alert strategy is innovative as it integrates police work with mental health services, creating a system where the police act as the first point of contact for bereaved individuals and facilitate access to postvention support【157†source】.

Disruption​(4 (5))rch challenges the traditional role of law enforcement by positioning police officers as facilitators of mental health care, which could disrupt standard practices within both public health and criminal justice systems .

7. Sustainability Considerations
Sustainability: The strategy promotes sustainable support systems for those bereaved by suicide by ensuring they receive timely access to services that address their psychological, social, and legal needs. It fosters a multi-agency collaboration that can be maintained over time【157†source】.

*Ethical Considerations​(4 (5)) emphasizes the importance of voluntary consent when police collect contact details for referrals to support services. Ensuring the ethical collection of personal data at a time of grief is a critical element of the strategy【157†source】 .

8. Implementation​(4 (5))lementation: The strategy can be easily implemented in other regions with minimal adaptation, as it builds on existing police protocols for responding to deaths. The study provides practical recommendations for how to embed the strategy into routine police operations【157†source】.
Usability: The findings are high​(4 (5)) police forces, mental health organizations, and public health departments to improve their approaches to suicide postvention. The study outlines a clear process for how to handle suicide cases and refer bereaved individuals to support services【157†source】.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Glo​(4 (5))e
Cross-Disciplinary Impact: The study sits at the intersection of public health, mental health services, and law enforcement, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration. The findings are relevant to fields such as suicide prevention, mental health postvention, and policing【157†source】 .

Global Relevance: Although cond​(4 (5))ategy can be adapted globally, especially in countries facing similar challenges related to mental health crises and suicide prevention. The model’s emphasis on early intervention is relevant in both high-income and low-resource settings .

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience
shows resilience by enhancing the ability of the police and support services to respond quickly and effectively to suicides, providing early intervention that can reduce the risk of prolonged grief and compounded trauma for survivors【157†source】.

Adaptability: The strategy can be adapted to various l​(4 (5))s, as it does not rely on specialized technology or infrastructure. It is flexible enough to be modified based on the resources and needs of different communities【157†source】 .

Conclusion
The **police-led suicide early alert stra​(4 (5))study demonstrates significant potential across multiple research impact dimensions. It innovates by involving police in postvention care, offers scalable and transferable solutions, and promotes sustainability through multi-agency collaboration. The strategy has global relevance and could be applied in diverse settings to improve suicide prevention and postvention services.
