
Based on the study titled “A Qualitative Study of Health Promotion in Academy Schools in England,” the research impact dimensions of the study are presented as follows, aligning with the findings and predefined guidelines:

1. Domains of Research Impact
This dimension refers to the primary sectors where the research has an impact:

Public Health Domain: The study has significant implications for child and adolescent health promotion by exploring the role of academy schools in implementing health promotion initiatives. It addresses the mental, physical, and emotional well-being of students, highlighting the importance of schools in promoting health​(5 (3)).

Education Domain: The research contributes to the education sector by examining how health promotion is linked to educational attainment. It emphasizes that healthier students tend to perform better academically, showing how academies can contribute to both health and educational outcomes​(5 (3)).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact: The immediate impact of the research lies in raising awareness among academy trust leaders about the importance of health promotion in schools. The findings highlight the variability in how health promotion is implemented across academies and provide insights for school leaders and policymakers​(5 (3)).

Long-Term Impact: Over the long term, the study’s recommendations could influence the development of national health promotion policies for schools, particularly in the absence of centralized health promotion strategies for academies. Implementing a strategic approach to health promotion in academy schools could lead to sustained improvements in student health and educational outcomes​(5 (3)).

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The key stakeholders include academy trust leaders, headteachers, and educational policy developers, who are responsible for making decisions on health promotion strategies. These individuals play a crucial role in shaping how health promotion is incorporated into the school environment​(5 (3)).

Indirect Stakeholders: Indirectly, the students, parents, and public health agencies are also affected by the findings. Improved health promotion efforts in academies will benefit students’ well-being and educational attainment, while public health agencies may use the research to advocate for more structured interventions​(5 (3)).

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: The study provides an in-depth understanding of the current gaps in health promotion within academy schools. It explores the barriers and facilitators of health promotion, emphasizing the importance of leadership and financial resources in determining whether health initiatives are implemented​(5 (3)).

Breadth of Impact: The findings have broader implications for schools across the UK and potentially other countries with similar school systems. The research sheds light on the importance of embedding health promotion as part of a school’s core strategy, influencing policy at a local and national level​(5 (3)).

5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study identifies health promotion strategies that can be scaled up across other multi-academy trusts (MATs) and single academy trusts (SATs). With support from local authorities and public health agencies, the models discussed in the study could be expanded to a wider network of schools​(5 (3)).

Transferability: The findings are transferable to other educational settings beyond the academy school system. The recommendations on how to integrate health promotion into the curriculum and school culture can be adapted for maintained schools, free schools, and international educational systems​(5 (3)).

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study highlights an innovative approach by proposing that academy trusts take a more strategic and centralized approach to health promotion, moving away from the current model where individual schools often act independently. It suggests that health should be seen as integral to education, not an optional add-on​(5 (3)).

Disruption: By emphasizing the need for systematic health promotion, the research could disrupt traditional views on school governance in the UK. It challenges academy trusts to rethink their priorities, shifting the focus from solely educational outcomes to a more holistic view of student well-being​(5 (3)).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes the sustainability of health promotion efforts by calling for a more structured and strategic approach within academy schools. It argues that embedding health promotion into the school’s operational framework will ensure long-term benefits for both students and staff​(5 (3)).

Ethical Considerations: The study raises ethical concerns about the inequitable access to health promotion across different schools. It highlights that some schools lack resources or leadership commitment to provide adequate health support, and recommends that all students, regardless of their school’s status, should have access to health-promoting initiatives​(5 (3)).

8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research findings provide practical recommendations for academy trust leaders on how to implement health promotion strategies. These include allocating dedicated budgets for health-related activities and engaging external partners, such as public health teams and third-sector organizations, to support schools in delivering effective health programs​(5 (3)).

Usability: The study is highly usable for policymakers, educational leaders, and public health practitioners who are looking to develop or improve health promotion strategies in schools. The research offers actionable insights that can be applied at both the school level and trust level, ensuring that health promotion becomes a priority in educational settings​(5 (3)).

9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-Disciplinary Impact: The research bridges the gap between education and public health, showing how collaboration between these two sectors can result in better health and educational outcomes for students. The findings are relevant to public health practitioners, educational policymakers, and school administrators​(5 (3)).

Global Relevance: Although the study is based on academy schools in England, its findings are relevant internationally. Countries with similar challenges in school health promotion can adapt the recommendations to their own educational systems, particularly in contexts where schools have autonomy over health-related decisions​(5 (3)).

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study highlights the resilience of schools that have adopted a whole-school approach to health promotion, demonstrating that even in the face of financial constraints, some schools prioritize health because of the significant challenges their students face, such as poverty and mental health issues​(5 (3)).

Adaptability: The recommendations provided in the study are adaptable to different school environments. Whether a school is part of a large multi-academy trust or a smaller trust, the strategies for implementing health promotion can be tailored to fit the specific needs and resources of each institution​(5 (3)).

Conclusion
The study on health promotion in academy schools has broad and significant implications across multiple dimensions. It emphasizes the role of academy trusts in shaping health outcomes for students and provides clear recommendations for integrating health promotion into school strategies. By advocating for a more systematic and equitable approach to health promotion, the study can influence both educational policy and public health practices, ensuring that student well-being is prioritized alongside academic achievement.
