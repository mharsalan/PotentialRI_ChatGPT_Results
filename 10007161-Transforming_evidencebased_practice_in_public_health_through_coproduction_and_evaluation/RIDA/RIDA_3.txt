Here are the Research Impact Dimensions for the study on "Exploring young women’s perspectives of a targeted support programme for teenage parents." The study investigates the experiences of teenage mothers participating in a support program in the North East of England. The impact dimensions cover various areas, including social, educational, and health impacts.

1. Domains of Research Impact
This dimension refers to the different areas or sectors where the research exerts influence. The study influences several domains:

Health Domain: The research directly impacts the mental health and emotional well-being of teenage mothers. It addresses parental stress, social isolation, and emotional challenges, improving mental health outcomes for both mothers and children​(3 (7)).
Educational Domain: The study contributes to education by demonstrating that targeted support programs can increase engagement in education and employment for teenage mothers​(3 (7)).
Social Domain: The findings contribute to social inclusion by reducing isolation and providing young mothers with social support systems through peer interactions. This, in turn, promotes community cohesion​(3 (7)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediate outcomes include the reduction of social isolation and improved emotional well-being of teenage mothers, as well as the development of parenting skills during their participation in the program​(3 (7)).
Long-term Impact: The study highlights how participation in such programs can have lasting effects, such as enhanced social and emotional development for both mothers and their children, and increased engagement in education and employment, which can improve socio-economic outcomes over time​(3 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The primary beneficiaries are the teenage mothers participating in the program and their children, as the program improves their emotional well-being, parenting skills, and educational opportunities​(3 (7)).
Indirect Stakeholders: Public health departments, local authorities, and educational institutions benefit indirectly through reduced social isolation among young parents and improved outcomes in terms of educational and employment engagement​(3 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: The program has a deep impact within the field of support services for young parents, contributing to understanding how holistic support can reduce social isolation, enhance parenting skills, and improve access to education and employment opportunities​(3 (7)).
Breadth of Impact: The findings have the potential to influence broader social services, especially those targeting vulnerable populations. The holistic approach taken in this program could be applied in various regions and to other vulnerable groups beyond teenage mothers​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The support program has the potential to be scaled up to other regions or national programs targeting teenage parents or young people from vulnerable backgrounds. The inclusion of elements such as free transport and childcare ensures the program’s accessibility, making it a model for scaling​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The program model is transferable to different contexts, including other areas of social care, such as programs for young fathers or at-risk youth, ensuring broader application beyond the specific population studied​(3 (7)).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The research introduces innovative elements in terms of holistic support for teenage mothers, including the provision of on-site childcare and free transport, which increases engagement and reduces barriers to participation​(3 (7)).
Disruption: The program disrupts traditional approaches by focusing on holistic support that includes emotional, social, and educational elements, rather than solely focusing on economic outcomes. It challenges existing models by demonstrating the need for comprehensive, multi-faceted support for vulnerable groups​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The program promotes long-term social and emotional well-being for teenage mothers and their children, leading to sustained engagement in education and employment. The inclusion of accessible childcare and transport services makes the program more inclusive and sustainable​(3 (7)).
Ethical Considerations: The program addresses ethical concerns by promoting equity and inclusivity, ensuring that vulnerable teenage mothers have access to the support they need without facing barriers related to transportation or childcare. It also empowers participants to advocate for their needs, which fosters autonomy​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The program's design, which includes key components like free transport and on-site childcare, makes it highly implementable in other regions and contexts. It also demonstrates clear practicality, as it can be easily adapted for local government-funded services​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The findings can be used by local authorities and public health services to improve existing programs aimed at supporting vulnerable young parents, especially those far from the employment market​(3 (7)).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research crosses the boundaries between public health, social care, and education. It provides valuable insights into how social support systems can intersect with mental health and education policy to improve outcomes for vulnerable populations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: While the study is based in the UK, the model can be adapted to other countries with similar challenges regarding teenage pregnancy and vulnerable youth populations, making it relevant in global contexts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The program demonstrates resilience by helping young mothers develop both emotional resilience and practical life skills, such as parenting and employability. It prepares them for long-term success beyond the duration of the program​(3 (7)).
Adaptability: The research shows that the support program can be adapted to different social service settings, including extending the age range of participants, which was done in subsequent cohorts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Conclusion
The research on the teenage parent support program highlights its potential for deep, long-term impacts across multiple dimensions, including health, education, and social care. It offers a scalable and transferable model for supporting vulnerable young parents and demonstrates innovation in how social services are delivered. The study’s findings are relevant not only for local contexts but also have global applications, making it a significant contribution to social support programs for young parents.
