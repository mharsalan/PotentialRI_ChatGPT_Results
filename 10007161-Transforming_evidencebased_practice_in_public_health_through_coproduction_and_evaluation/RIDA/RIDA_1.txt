To provide you with a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions based on the study in the document you provided, I will follow the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as mentioned in the reference document​(Knowledge - Potential R…). These dimensions include the academic, societal, and economic influence of the research, as well as its scalability, sustainability, and more.

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study focuses on co-creating and co-producing research evidence within health, social care, and education settings. This has a multi-domain impact:

Academic Domain: It contributes to the body of knowledge on translational research and implementation science by introducing practical ways of merging academic research with real-world practitioner needs​(1 (7)).
Social Domain: This research influences societal changes by providing methods for involving service users and practitioners directly in the research process, fostering a collaborative model that could enhance public health and social care services​(1 (7)).
Policy Domain: The research can shape policy frameworks, particularly in public health and education, by demonstrating the value of co-produced evidence in informing policy decisions​(1 (7)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact: The study can immediately influence public health interventions and social care practices by providing tools and guidelines for researchers and practitioners to co-produce meaningful evidence that can be quickly implemented into practice​(1 (7)).
Long-Term Impact: Over time, this research may form the basis for a more widespread shift toward co-production in public health, social care, and education, leading to more sustainable and context-specific solutions in these sectors​(1 (7)).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: These include academics, practitioners in public health, education, and social care, as well as service users. They benefit directly by utilizing co-produced research evidence in their work​(1 (7)).
Indirect Stakeholders: Policymakers, government bodies, and the wider public benefit indirectly as the research helps to create more effective interventions and policies based on co-produced evidence​(1 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: Within the field of public health and social care, this study has the potential to create profound changes in how research is conducted and applied, particularly by fostering collaborative approaches between academics and practitioners​(1 (7)).
Breadth of Impact: The principles of co-production can be applied across various sectors, including education and criminal justice, expanding the reach of the research beyond public health alone​(1 (7)).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The research model of co-production can be scaled up to larger public health initiatives, expanding from small, local-level interventions to national or even international programs​(1 (7)).
Transferability: The co-production approach is highly transferable to other fields, such as education and criminal justice, where similar challenges of translating research into practice exist​(1 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a co-production framework that is innovative because it challenges traditional top-down approaches to research. It promotes bottom-up collaboration, which could disrupt how research in public health and social care is typically conducted​(1 (7)).
Disruption: By encouraging researchers to work more closely with practitioners and service users, the study has the potential to disrupt the conventional hierarchy in academic research, making research more inclusive and context-specific​(1 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The co-production model promotes sustainability by ensuring that research findings are contextually relevant and have long-term applicability, especially in addressing local health needs​(1 (7)).
Ethical Considerations: Co-production ensures that service users and practitioners are involved in the research process from start to finish, which promotes ethical transparency and a more democratic approach to research​(1 (7)).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research provides a clear framework for implementing co-production in public health, social care, and education. It is highly usable by practitioners, policymakers, and academics who wish to apply co-produced evidence in real-world settings​(1 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Relevance: The co-production framework is applicable not just in public health but also in education, social care, and even sectors like criminal justice, making it relevant across a wide range of disciplines​(1 (7)).
Global Relevance: The study’s principles of co-production can be applied globally, particularly in regions where resource constraints require more collaborative and context-specific solutions​(1 (7)).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The co-production model is adaptable to changing circumstances, especially in public health settings where local contexts and priorities may shift rapidly​(1 (7)).
Adaptability: The study's co-production model can be adapted to different geographical and cultural contexts, making it useful in a variety of public health and social care systems​(1 (7))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Conclusion
The study demonstrates strong potential for impact across multiple dimensions. Its innovative co-production framework makes research more inclusive, context-specific, and applicable to real-world challenges in public health, social care, and education. The research can be scaled up and transferred to other fields, promoting sustainable practices and fostering global applicability. Through its focus on collaboration, the study holds the potential to disrupt traditional research hierarchies, creating more ethical and resilient outcomes.
