
Based on the study “Evaluation of a pilot police-led suicide early alert surveillance strategy in the United Kingdom,” here are the potential research impacts of the study aligned with predefined guidelines and dimensions:

1. Public Health Impact
The study contributes significantly to suicide postvention by creating an early alert system that expedites referrals for support services to those bereaved by suicide. This improves the timeliness of psychological support, which is critical in reducing the long-term mental health impact on the bereaved, who are often at higher risk of developing mental health issues, including depression and anxiety​(4 (5)) Social and Community Impact** The police-led surveillance system strengthens community health by promoting multi-agency collaboration between the police, public health teams, and bereavement support services. This facilitates better integration of services and ensures that bereaved individuals receive coordinated support, leading to stronger community ties and improved mental health outcomes for vulnerable groups【193†source​(4 (5)) Criminal Justice Impact** The study has a direct impact on criminal justice by positioning the police as key facilitators of suicide postvention services. It offers a novel approach where police officers not only investigate deaths but also serve as a bridge to mental health services for families affected by suicide. This expands the role of police in public health interventions, promoting early intervention and support .

The findings from this pilot program could shape national suicide prevention policies by showing how early intervention through a police-led strategy can improve the reach and efficiency of support services. The data collected could also influence how police forces integrate mental health support within their standard operating procedures for dealing with suspected suicides【193†source】 .

​(4 (5)) Enhancement
The program demonstrated a significant increase in referrals to postvention support services, which shows its potential to improve mental health service delivery. By facilitating faster referrals, the program ensures that bereavement support is provided when it is most needed, potentially reducing long-term psychological harm【193†source】.

6. Reduction​(4 (5))isparities
The study addresses the issue of inequitable access to postvention services, as many individuals bereaved by suicide traditionally had to seek out these services on their own, often years after the event. By directly connecting individuals to support services through police interaction, the program reduces this gap and ensures equitable access to mental health services .

*7. Scalability and Tran
The police-led surveillance strategy is highly scalable and transferable. The model can be adapted by other police forces across the UK and internationally, where similar public health and suicide prevention challenges exist. The strategy's emphasis on real-time intervention can also be applied to other public health crises that require rapid, coordinated responses【193†source】.

8. Innovation and Disru​(4 (5))ial
The integration of police work with mental health services is an innovative approach that disrupts traditional roles. It places the police in a public health intervention capacity, demonstrating how multi-agency cooperation can lead to faster, more effective delivery of support services. This challenges the traditional reactive role of the police and suggests a more proactive involvement in community health .

**9. Implementation of Best Practicey offers a practical framework for the implementation of a real-time suicide surveillance strategy that can be replicated in various regions. It emphasizes the importance of police training, effective communication with bereaved families, and collaboration with mental health support services to ensure the strategy's success【193†source】.
**10. Ethical and Social Considerati​(4 (5))udy also addresses important ethical considerations related to collecting personal data at a sensitive time. It highlights the need for police officers to be trained in how to sensitively handle bereavement situations, ensuring that the request for consent to share details with support services is done in a respectful and informed manner【193†source】 .
Research Impact Pathways Bef​(4 (5))n
Pre-Publication Pathways
Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration

Early engagement with police forces, public health authorities, and bereavement services is essential. This can be achieved through workshops or consultations, ensuring that the research aligns with both public health and law enforcement needs【193†source】.
Pilot Testing and Feedback

**Pilot prog​(4 (5))d be expanded to other regions to gather more data and refine the strategy based on feedback from officers and bereavement services. This ensures that the model is adaptable and can function in different policing contexts .
Preliminary Findings Dissemination

Presenting prndings at conferences related to public health, suicide prevention, and law enforcement will generate interest and allow for early critique and improvement. Preprints and early publications in open-access journals can also help share insights with a broader audience .
Post-Publication Pathways
Academic Dissemination

Pu study in peer-reviewed journals focused on public health, mental health, and police studies ensures the research reaches relevant academic communities. This could inspire further research into similar multi-agency approaches in other regions【193†source】.
Knowledge Transfer to Law Enforcement and Public Health Agencies (4 (5))ts** and training programs should be developed for police officers, detailing how to handle suspected suicides and engage with bereaved families. Public health agencies can also benefit from guidelines on integrating mental health support into law enforcement processes【193†source】 .

Policy Influence and Advocacy

Engaging with **government pol​(4 (5)) this strategy into national suicide prevention frameworks will ensure that the findings have a broad impact. Policy briefs summarizing the benefits of the police-led strategy should be shared with national and regional public health authorities .
Community and Media Engagement

Promoting the study’s findings through **media outlepers, TV, and radio) will help raise public awareness of the importance of early intervention in suicide prevention. Community workshops can also help spread knowledge about the strategy and its benefits【193†source】.
Pre- and Post-Publication Promotion
Social Media Campaigns: Leveraging Twitt​(4 (5))edIn, and ResearchGate to share updates, key insights, and data visualizations from the study can engage both the academic community and practitioners【193†source】.

Press Releases and Media Outreach: Issuing press releases that highlight the inno​(4 (5))ts of the police-led strategy will attract attention from mainstream media, helping to raise awareness about the importance of suicide postvention services .

Public Webinars and Panels: Hosting webinars and panel discussions involving **police repre, mental health professionals, and public health officials will foster interdisciplinary dialogue and encourage adoption of the model in other regions【193†source】.

Conclusion
The study demonstrates a significant potential to impact public health, men​(4 (5))ervices, and law enforcement practices. By promoting early and effective postvention support through a police-led strategy, the research offers a scalable model that can be implemented nationally and internationally. Careful pre- and post-publication dissemination strategies, along with stakeholder engagement and media promotion, will help maximize the study's reach and impact.
