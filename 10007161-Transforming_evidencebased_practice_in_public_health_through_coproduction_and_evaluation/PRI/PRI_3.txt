
Based on the study titled “Exploring young women’s perspectives of a targeted support programme for teenage parents”, here are the potential research impacts aligned with the findings and predefined instructions:

1. Health and Well-being Impact
The program offers significant contributions to improving the mental health and well-being of teenage mothers and their children. It addresses issues of social isolation, parental stress, and mental health problems, which are prevalent among teenage parents. By providing structured support and social engagement, the program helps reduce anxiety and promotes better emotional health, benefiting both mothers and children​(3 (7))​(Common Research Impact …).

2. Social and Community Impact
The program fosters social inclusion by providing a supportive environment where teenage mothers can connect with peers. It significantly reduces social isolation by offering a space where participants can share experiences and build relationships. This leads to better social integration and community cohesion, as the mothers feel more supported within their communities​(3 (7)).

3. Educational and Employment Impact
By increasing participation in education and employment, the program improves the long-term socio-economic outcomes for teenage mothers. It helps them build life skills, which boosts their confidence and increases their likelihood of re-engaging in formal education or securing employment​(3 (7))​(Research impact toolkit).

4. Policy Influence
The study’s findings can shape public health and social policy, particularly in the design of support services for vulnerable young parents. The program demonstrates the value of providing holistic support, including free childcare and transportation, to increase accessibility and engagement, which could inform future government-funded programs​(3 (7))​(impact pathway).

5. Child Development Impact
The program has a positive impact on child development by providing early childhood socialization opportunities through the crèche service, which supports children’s emotional and social growth. This aligns with the early years framework and contributes to better developmental outcomes​(3 (7)).

6. Economic Impact
Although not immediately visible, the program has the potential for economic benefits by increasing teenage mothers' participation in employment and reducing their long-term reliance on social welfare systems. By helping mothers become self-sufficient, the program contributes to broader economic stability​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Equity and Inclusivity
The program promotes equity by targeting teenage mothers from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, offering them essential services that they would otherwise struggle to access. The provision of free transport and childcare lowers barriers to participation, ensuring that even the most vulnerable young parents are included​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

8. Capacity Building and Training
By equipping teenage mothers with life skills and the opportunity to earn accredited qualifications, the program contributes to capacity building. It strengthens their resilience and equips them with the tools they need to navigate parenthood and their personal development​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

9. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The program is innovative in its holistic approach, integrating social, educational, and emotional support into a single intervention. It disrupts traditional support models by offering a comprehensive service that caters to both the mothers and their children, proving that this multi-faceted approach can produce significant social and educational benefits​(3 (7))​(Research impact toolkit).

10. Long-term Societal Impact
The study highlights the potential for long-term societal change by reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty and poor educational outcomes. By empowering young mothers and supporting their children’s early development, the program lays the groundwork for breaking the cycle of disadvantage in vulnerable populations​(3 (7))​(impact pathway).

These dimensions demonstrate how the study's findings have the potential to shape multiple sectors, including health, education, social policy, and community development, while promoting inclusivity and long-term societal benefits.
