Based on the contents of the uploaded document titled “Co-creating and Co-producing Research Evidence: A Guide for Practitioners and Academics in Health, Social Care and Education Settings”​(1 (7)), and the general framework for research impact dimensions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…), here are the potential research impacts of this study aligned with common research impact dimensions.

1. Academic Impact
The study enhances the academic understanding of the co-creation and co-production of research, providing a novel framework for how academics and practitioners can collaborate to generate evidence that is directly applicable to practice. It contributes to:

Translational Research: The study aids in translating theoretical frameworks into real-world applications by emphasizing practical, applied research methods.
Methodological Contributions: By outlining co-production methods across health, social care, and education settings, it broadens the methodological toolkit for academics working in these fields​(Common Research Impact …)​(1 (7)).
2. Social Impact
This study has a significant social impact, particularly in the way research is conducted in health and social care. The collaborative approach leads to more contextually relevant interventions and solutions, which directly benefit society by:

Improving Public Health and Social Care: The application of co-produced research leads to more tailored health and social care interventions, improving the quality of services for vulnerable populations​(1 (7))​(impact pathway).
Empowering Service Users and Practitioners: By involving practitioners and service users in the research process, the study empowers these groups to have a say in the research outcomes, fostering a sense of ownership and ensuring that interventions are more effective and accepted​(1 (7)).
3. Economic Impact
The research has the potential to generate economic benefits by creating more cost-effective and efficient interventions in public health and education:

Cost Efficiency in Public Health: Co-produced interventions are more likely to be relevant and effective, reducing the costs associated with trial-and-error approaches in health services​(Common Research Impact …).
Improving Workforce Productivity: The involvement of practitioners in the research process can lead to improvements in practice that enhance the productivity of the workforce in public health, education, and social care​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Impact
The study can influence policy frameworks within health, education, and social care sectors:

Evidence-Based Policy: The co-production of research leads to evidence-informed policy that is directly relevant to practitioners, improving the alignment between policy goals and practical needs​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Informing Health and Social Care Reforms: The findings can help shape national policies regarding collaborative research models, advocating for the integration of practitioner knowledge into policy-making​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
While not the central focus, the study’s model for collaborative research could contribute to sustainable development in terms of systemic improvements in health and education:

Sustainable Research Models: By focusing on co-production, the research advocates for more sustainable research practices where resources (both human and financial) are used more efficiently through collaboration​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Depth and Breadth of Impact
The study’s depth of impact lies within the health and social care sectors, particularly where there are gaps in traditional research methods:

Deep Impact: It transforms the way research evidence is produced and applied in health services and social care, particularly in settings where traditional research might be too disconnected from practice​(Common Research Impact …).
Breadth of Impact: Its principles are broadly applicable across multiple sectors, including education, criminal justice, and public health, making the model transferable to various disciplines​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Innovation and Disruption Potential
The co-production model represents an innovative approach that disrupts traditional hierarchical models of research:

Innovation: The study fosters innovation by integrating practitioner knowledge into the research process from the early stages, creating more practical and applied outcomes​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruption: It challenges the traditional academic-driven research model, promoting a bottom-up approach that values the knowledge of practitioners and service users just as much as academic expertise​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Implementation and Usability
The study offers a highly usable framework for co-producing research across various sectors:

Practical Application: Its guidelines and examples of co-produced research provide a clear framework that can be easily implemented by both academics and practitioners in their respective fields​(Research impact toolkit)​(1 (7)).
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
The study has cross-disciplinary relevance beyond health and social care, including education, criminal justice, and other public sectors:

Global Applicability: The principles of co-production can be applied globally, particularly in low-resource settings, where collaboration between researchers and local practitioners is essential for creating context-specific solutions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The co-production model is highly adaptable to various contexts and challenges:

Resilience in Changing Environments: It allows for the research process to remain relevant and responsive to changing policy landscapes and emerging challenges in public health and social care​(Research impact toolkit).
Conclusion
The study provides numerous potential research impacts across academic, social, economic, and policy domains. Its focus on co-production ensures that the research is directly applicable to practice, resulting in sustainable, efficient, and contextually relevant solutions. The model's scalability and transferability make it adaptable across different sectors and regions, offering a broad societal impact that fosters collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and service users.
