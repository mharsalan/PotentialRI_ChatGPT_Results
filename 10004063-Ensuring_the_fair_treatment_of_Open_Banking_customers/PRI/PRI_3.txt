The study on "Towards Effective, Consent-Based Control of Personal Data" has a wide range of potential research impacts based on its subject matter, focusing on privacy, data protection, and consent mechanisms. Drawing from multiple frameworks such as the Common Research Impact Dimensions​(Common Research Impact …), here are some detailed potential impacts:

1. Policy and Regulatory Impact
Policy Domain: The research can directly influence data protection laws and policies, particularly those surrounding explicit consent in personal data management. It aligns closely with current EU regulations on data protection (GDPR), where dynamic consent models could inform legislative frameworks and regulatory updates.
Example: This study can shape how policymakers draft new legislation or amend existing policies to ensure better protection of personal data in both the public and private sectors​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Technological and Innovation Impact
Technological Domain: The research contributes to developing innovative consent technologies, such as dynamic consent systems that can be integrated into digital platforms, apps, or services that handle personal data. This could spur innovation in privacy technologies across industries that depend heavily on personal data, such as healthcare, banking, and online services.
Disruption Potential: This study disrupts traditional, static models of consent by introducing a more user-centric, flexible system. This paradigm shift can influence both technological development and societal expectations of privacy management​(3 (1) (2))​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Social Impact
Social Domain: The study has potential social impacts by empowering individuals with greater control over their personal data. This could lead to shifts in public behavior regarding privacy and data sharing, enhancing user trust in data-driven platforms. It can also influence public discourse on data ethics, creating broader societal awareness on privacy rights​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Health and Well-being Impact
Health Domain: Within healthcare and biobanking research, the dynamic consent model improves ethical oversight by allowing participants to adjust their consent preferences over time. This promotes ethical data usage in healthcare, which can lead to improved patient trust and participation in medical research​(Research impact toolkit)​(3 (1) (2)).
Example: Enhanced participation in biobanking could lead to breakthroughs in medical research, by securing more diverse and ethical datasets​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Economic and Market Impact
Economic Domain: The implementation of dynamic consent systems could have an economic impact by creating new markets for privacy-enhancing technologies. Businesses that adopt these models could experience economic benefits by reducing regulatory risks and improving customer trust.
Example: Industries, particularly in technology and healthcare, that adopt these dynamic consent frameworks might see increased market share due to their alignment with ethical data practices​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Ethical and Sustainability Impact
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations: The study addresses long-term sustainability by ensuring that consent mechanisms can evolve with technological advancements and changing societal expectations. It also raises ethical standards by emphasizing continuous, informed consent, which aligns with global efforts to enhance digital privacy and protect human rights​(3 (1) (2))​(Common Research Impact …).
Example: This research can influence sustainability in data management practices, ensuring that businesses and healthcare systems remain compliant with evolving ethical norms​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The dynamic consent model’s relevance stretches across multiple fields, including law, healthcare, technology, and social science, providing a foundational framework that can be adapted for use in various sectors. Globally, it could serve as a standard for privacy practices in international organizations dealing with personal data​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Example: Its application could influence global data governance, particularly in regions adopting strict data protection laws like the EU​(impact pathway).
8. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Academic Domain: This study adds to the academic discourse on data privacy, contributing to theoretical knowledge on how dynamic consent models can replace traditional, rigid consent structures. It could serve as a basis for future research in data ethics, privacy law, and information technology​(Common Research Impact …).
Example: Subsequent studies could build on this research to explore new applications of consent models in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and smart cities​(3 (1) (2))​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Public Awareness and Education
The research can influence public education by increasing awareness about personal data rights and ethical data usage. Educational campaigns, informed by the findings, can help shift public attitudes toward more responsible data sharing and strengthen civic understanding of privacy issues​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Legal and Ethical Impacts
Legal Domain: The framework challenges current legal interpretations of consent, particularly regarding personal autonomy in data sharing. It can lead to judicial rulings that reinforce the necessity for explicit and continuous consent in all interactions involving personal data​(3 (1) (2))​(Common Research Impact …).
11. Implementation and Usability
Usability Impact: The proposed system can be readily implemented within existing infrastructures in industries like healthcare, offering scalable and flexible consent management solutions. This could improve compliance with complex regulatory frameworks such as GDPR​(3 (1) (2))​(Common Research Impact …).
By addressing both short-term and long-term societal needs, the research offers a wide-reaching, multidisciplinary impact that could reshape data management and privacy practices across multiple industries globally.
