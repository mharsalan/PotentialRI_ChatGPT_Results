Based on the provided text in your study, I will now map the research to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, as per your request.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study, focused on financial data consent in the context of Open Banking, primarily impacts the economic, policy, and technological domains. It explores how financial data is handled by third-party providers (TPPs) and investigates the mechanisms of informed consent, relevant to the financial services sector, consumer protection policies, and data governance technologies.
Examples:
Policy domain: The research could influence how GDPR and other consumer protection laws evolve to ensure better data management and protection in financial services​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Economic domain: Improving informed consent mechanisms could lead to higher consumer trust and more adoption of financial technology services, driving innovation and economic growth in the financial sector.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study has potential short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, it can be applied to the Open Banking framework by enhancing how consent is managed. Over the long term, the insights could shape future financial regulations and the development of user-centered data management systems.
Examples:
Short-term: Immediately after the research, financial services could adopt more transparent consent mechanisms.
Long-term: The framework may inform global standards for data management, influencing policies around consumer data rights for years​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(6 (2)).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: Stakeholders include financial service providers, third-party application developers, regulators (such as those implementing GDPR), and consumers. Consumers are the primary beneficiaries, gaining more control and clarity over their financial data.
Examples:
Direct stakeholders: Financial service providers and GDPR regulators, who implement better consent processes.
Indirect stakeholders: The public benefits from increased data protection and more secure financial services​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact

Examples:
Deep impact: Transformation of how financial institutions approach customer consent for data use, ensuring greater compliance with legal frameworks like GDPR​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Broad impact: Other industries dealing with personal data (healthcare, e-commerce) could adapt these consent models, making them more transparent and user-focused​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The consent models introduced by this research are highly scalable within the financial sector and transferable to other areas where data consent is critical, such as healthcare and e-commerce.
Examples:
Scalability: The research could be scaled from a national (UK Open Banking) to a global level, influencing data management in international financial markets​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The models for managing data consent could be adapted to other sectors like healthcare to manage patient consent in digital health records​(6 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The study introduces an innovative approach to managing data consent, incorporating user-friendly designs that reduce behavioral manipulation and enhance transparency. This has disruptive potential by changing how both consumers and third-party providers manage consent.
Examples:
Innovation: The use of behavioral insights to make consent processes more intuitive and user-centered could lead to new tools for digital privacy management​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: It challenges traditional consent models, potentially forcing the financial services industry to adopt more rigorous consent standards​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The study emphasizes sustainability by proposing long-term, adaptable consent mechanisms. It also addresses ethical considerations by promoting a consent model that is informed, unambiguous, and freely given, thus aligning with GDPR and other ethical standards.
Examples:
Sustainability: The dynamic consent model ensures long-term applicability by evolving with legal requirements such as GDPR​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethics: The research strengthens the ethical use of consumer data, ensuring consumers understand how their financial data is being used​(6 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The research focuses on improving usability in consent processes, recommending practical changes that make it easier for consumers to understand and manage their consent. This enhances the user experience and simplifies compliance for service providers.
Examples:
Implementation: Financial institutions can implement simplified consent interfaces that reduce the complexity of terms and conditions, making them more accessible​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: Consumers are more likely to engage with and understand their data rights, improving overall user satisfaction​(6 (2)).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The study’s findings are relevant across multiple disciplines, including law, behavioral economics, technology, and consumer rights. Its global relevance is seen in the way it addresses issues around GDPR, open banking, and international data protection laws.
Examples:
Cross-disciplinary: The research could inform legal frameworks, influence technological innovation, and guide consumer protection policies across various sectors​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global relevance: As countries adopt similar open banking and data protection frameworks, this research has potential global applications, influencing policy makers and service providers internationally​(6 (2)).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The proposed consent framework is designed to be resilient and adaptable to future changes in privacy laws and technological advancements. It provides a flexible model that can evolve as consumer expectations and legal standards change.
Examples:
Resilience: The consent model can be updated to remain compliant with emerging global privacy laws, ensuring it remains relevant in a changing regulatory environment​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Adaptability: As technologies like AI and machine learning evolve, the consent model can integrate these innovations to improve data protection​(6 (2))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
These detailed dimensions provide a comprehensive understanding of how the research study impacts various fields, stakeholders, and long-term societal goals. It has far-reaching implications, particularly in financial services, policy, and data governance, while also offering scalable solutions applicable in other sectors.
