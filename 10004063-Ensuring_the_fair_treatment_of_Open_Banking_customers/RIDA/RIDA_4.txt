5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The dynamic consent model demonstrates high potential for scalability and transferability:

Scalability: The model can be scaled from individual healthcare systems to national biobanking platforms, or even other sectors dealing with personal data​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: It is transferable across industries such as financial services, public administration, and legal systems, where data privacy is crucial​(4 (2)).
Examples:

Scalability: From local biobank implementations to global healthcare data systems.
Transferability: Adapting dynamic consent models for sectors like banking and law.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: This study introduces innovation by redefining how personal data is consented to and managed:

Disruption: It disrupts the traditional static consent model by creating a flexible, patient-controlled dynamic consent system​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(4 (2)).
Examples:

Innovation: The research integrates privacy-enhancing technologies that allow users to modify consent over time, transforming how organizations handle personal data.
Disruption: It fundamentally changes data management in healthcare by allowing dynamic adjustments to consent over time, shifting the balance of control to the individual.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The study has a strong focus on sustainability and ethical standards:

Sustainability: The dynamic consent model ensures that privacy management practices are adaptable to future technological and regulatory changes​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethics: By focusing on patient autonomy, it promotes ethical data management, respecting individuals' right to control their data​(4 (2)).
Examples:

Sustainability: The model is adaptable, ensuring long-term applicability in healthcare data systems.
Ethics: It strengthens the ethical management of sensitive personal data, aligning with international privacy standards.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The research emphasizes easy implementation:

Implementation: The dynamic consent system is designed to be easily integrated into existing biobanking and healthcare infrastructures, enhancing data governance with minimal disruption​(4 (2)).
Usability: Its user-friendly interface ensures that both patients and administrators can navigate consent settings without complex systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Examples:

Implementation: Healthcare institutions can seamlessly adopt dynamic consent without overhauling their existing infrastructure.
