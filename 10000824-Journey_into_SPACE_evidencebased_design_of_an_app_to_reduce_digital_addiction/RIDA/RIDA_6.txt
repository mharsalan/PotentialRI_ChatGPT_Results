I will now provide a detailed assessment of the research paper titled "Perceptions and Misperceptions of Smartphone Use: Applying the Social Norms Approach" across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"There is potential to apply the social norms approach to digital addiction and, in doing so, address some of the limitations of the social norms field." (Introduction, Page 1)
This study addresses the domains of behavioral psychology, public health, and digital technology, focusing on social norms and their application to managing smartphone use and combating digital addiction.
Example: The research contributes to the public health domain by addressing digital addiction as an emerging issue that can affect well-being. It also applies behavioral psychology to understand how social norms shape perceptions of smartphone use, while contributing to the technology domain by developing app-based interventions.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"By working with the developers of a commercial app, the SPACE app, we aimed to address the following research questions..." (Introduction, Page 2)
The study uses real-time data collection to monitor smartphone use and evaluate long-term changes, suggesting the potential for sustainable interventions in smartphone usage behavior.
Example: This research has the potential to influence long-term behavior change by promoting sustainable reductions in smartphone use through real-time feedback, addressing digital addiction over time.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Participants were recruited with the assistance of the creators of the SPACE app... App users were recruited to act as study participants." (Methodology, Page 3)
Key stakeholders include app developers, public health officials, and psychologists interested in reducing digital addiction, as well as smartphone users who are directly impacted by excessive smartphone use.
Example: App developers are stakeholders as they can implement social norms-based interventions into their products to reduce digital addiction. Public health officials can also apply these findings to broader health initiatives aimed at curbing problematic technology use.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Both self-reported and perceived overall time spent using a smartphone per day were higher than the actual norm of 202 min of use per day." (Results, Page 5)
The study offers deep insights into misperceptions about smartphone usage and the psychological mechanisms that drive these behaviors. The findings also have broad applications in fields such as public health, behavioral interventions, and app development.
Example: The depth of impact lies in its detailed analysis of how social norms shape perceptions of smartphone use. The breadth extends to various sectors, including public health campaigns, education, and technology design, where smartphone overuse is a concern.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Participants were presented with personalized data on their own smartphone use compared to their perceptions of others’ behavior." (Methods, Page 4)
The method of collecting real-time smartphone data and comparing it to social norms perceptions is highly scalable and can be transferred to other forms of digital behavior interventions, such as for social media or gaming.
Example: The approach can be scaled to other digital addictions, such as excessive gaming or internet use, and transferred to other behavior change campaigns using personalized data collection and feedback mechanisms.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"We also document the discrepancy between self-report and smartphone usage data as recorded through data collected directly from the device." (Abstract, Page 1)
The integration of objective smartphone data collection with personalized social norms feedback represents an innovative approach that could disrupt traditional behavioral interventions by providing real-time, personalized insights.
Example: The use of smartphone apps to gather real-time data and deliver personalized feedback is an innovative approach that has the potential to disrupt traditional self-report methods used in public health and behavioral change interventions.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"There is a risk that an inappropriately delivered social norms intervention will lead to a reactance effect, where the target population engages in that behavior more strongly." (Introduction, Page 2)
The study acknowledges the potential ethical risks of backfiring interventions, where users may increase smartphone use if the intervention is poorly designed, making sustainability a key consideration in the intervention's design.
Example: The research considers ethical implications such as the potential for negative psychological effects (e.g., reactance) if users reject the intervention. Designing interventions that are ethically sound and sustainable is crucial for ensuring long-term success.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The SPACE app provides a personalized behavior change programme designed to enable users to take greater control of their smartphone usage." (Methodology, Page 3)
The SPACE app’s personalized feedback model is practical and ready for implementation in behavior change interventions for smartphone use, offering users a usable system for self-regulation.
Example: The usability of this research is evident in the SPACE app’s design, which offers real-time, personalized feedback to help users manage their smartphone use. This makes the intervention both practical and implementable on a wide scale.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The study covered a wide geographical region, consisting primarily of participants from the USA, the UK, and Australia, including participants from 21 other countries." (Results, Page 6)
The study’s findings are relevant across different cultures and social groups, with global relevance in addressing smartphone overuse and addiction.
Example: This research has cross-disciplinary relevance, combining insights from psychology, public health, and technology to address digital addiction. Its global relevance is underscored by the wide range of participants from different countries and cultural backgrounds.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Most participants were found to overestimate how much time they spend on their smartphone per day but underestimate how often they check their smartphone." (Results, Page 7)
The study’s methodology shows resilience in adapting to different user behaviors, helping individuals correct misperceptions about their smartphone use.
Example: The adaptive nature of the social norms approach in this study ensures that interventions can be tailored to individual behaviors, allowing for resilient and flexible applications in various contexts of digital addiction.
