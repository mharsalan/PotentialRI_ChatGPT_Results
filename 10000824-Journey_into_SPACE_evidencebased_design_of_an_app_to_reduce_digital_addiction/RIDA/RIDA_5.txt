I will now assess the research paper titled "Online Peer Groups as a Persuasive Tool to Combat Digital Addiction" across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact."

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"This paper explores the design of online peer groups as a persuasive technique that puts together people who share a common interest in combating their DA or in helping others to do so." (Abstract, Page 1)
The study focuses on the digital health, psychology, and technology domains, examining how peer groups can assist in behavioral change, particularly in reducing digital addiction.
Example: This research impacts the digital health domain by exploring how online peer groups can serve as interventions for digital addiction. It also touches the psychology domain by utilizing principles of behavior change and peer influence and the technology domain by designing persuasive systems.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"This paper introduces online peer groups as a persuasive mechanism based on self-regulation systems, to support an effective and long-term behavioural change to combat DA." (Introduction, Page 2)
The paper highlights how online peer groups can be a sustainable solution for long-term behavioral change, as peer interactions support continuous self-regulation over time.
Example: The long-term impact of this research lies in its potential to provide a sustainable behavioral change mechanism for individuals struggling with digital addiction. Peer groups can offer continuous support, making the intervention more durable than short-term treatment programs.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Participants highlighted the important role of having the human element in software systems advocating techniques like peer groups to build a sense of trust and commitment to support long-term change." (Results, Page 5)
The key stakeholders include digital health professionals, software developers, and behavioral psychologists. Digital addicts and their support networks, such as family and friends, also stand to benefit from the research findings.
Example: Health professionals can apply this research in creating digital intervention programs, while software developers can use it to design platforms that incorporate peer groups for digital health. Behavioral psychologists could utilize the results to tailor therapies around digital addiction.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"The overall impression was positive, and 71% felt that a peer group would be useful... However, there is a paradox in supporting online addiction by inviting people to partake in online support." (Results, Page 5)
The research offers deep insights into peer group dynamics for combating digital addiction and broad applications across various digital health interventions, extending to other forms of addiction like gaming and social media.
Example: The depth of impact involves a detailed exploration of how online peer groups can drive behavioral change. The breadth extends to different types of addictions, including gaming and social media, potentially broadening the scope of similar interventions.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Peer groups approach can be an appropriate program for users in the transition to addiction stage... It can also benefit those unaware of their level of addiction by making them more informed of the consequences experienced by their peers." (Introduction, Page 3)
The peer group model is scalable as it can be applied across different addiction stages and transferred to various contexts where group-based support for addiction is necessary.
Example: The peer group approach is scalable to other forms of addiction, such as gambling or internet addiction, and can be transferred to different platforms, offering flexibility in deployment across various demographics and geographic regions.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"This paper explores the potential of online peer groups as a persuasive technique... The results raise a range of questions and challenges to address when developing such a technique for behavior change." (Abstract, Page 1)
The research introduces an innovative approach by combining technology with social group dynamics to combat addiction. It challenges traditional methods, like in-patient care, by offering a more accessible, digital alternative.
Example: This study introduces disruptive innovation by proposing online peer groups as an alternative to expensive, in-patient digital addiction treatments. This could transform the way addiction is treated by using digital interventions instead of traditional therapeutic methods.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Participants highlighted the important role of having a human element... There was a legitimate concern that there is a high risk of peers developing deviant behaviors due to normative influence." (Results, Page 6)
Ethical considerations, such as peer pressure and the risk of negative group dynamics, are acknowledged. The study suggests monitoring group interactions to mitigate these risks, ensuring the sustainability of the intervention.
Example: The research promotes sustainability by advocating for carefully monitored peer groups to prevent harmful behaviors, such as peer pressure or negative social influence. This ensures the long-term viability of online peer group interventions while addressing ethical concerns.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Participants were asked to install one of three commercial digital diet smartphones applications and use it for 14 days, and to record their observations." (Methods, Page 4)
The research includes practical implementation strategies, such as using smartphone applications for tracking and regulating digital addiction through peer monitoring, making the concept highly usable.
Example: The study offers usability insights by testing how users interact with digital tools for addiction management. The implementation of smartphone apps for tracking and peer group interactions makes it a feasible solution for digital health interventions.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The social norms approach has been successfully used for behavioral change in the domain of addiction as well as a number of health and socially relevant behaviors." (Discussion, Page 7)
The research bridges psychology, technology, and public health, making it relevant to global efforts to combat digital addiction. Its focus on peer groups and social norms also has cross-disciplinary appeal.
Example: This study is globally relevant, as digital addiction is a worldwide issue. Its cross-disciplinary nature connects psychology (behavioral change), public health (addiction treatment), and technology (peer support platforms), making it applicable to diverse settings and cultures.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Structuring peer groups should also consider the theme of addiction... online pornography would require a certain degree of anonymity." (Discussion, Page 6)
The study highlights the adaptability of peer groups, suggesting that the structure and governance of these groups should change depending on the type and severity of addiction, making the model resilient in different contexts.
Example: The adaptability of peer groups ensures that interventions can be customized based on the user's addiction level or the type of addiction being addressed. This flexibility contributes to the resilience of the intervention, making it suitable for a variety of addiction treatments.
