The study titled "Digital Addiction: A Requirements Engineering Perspective" by Amen Alrobai, Keith Phalp, and Raian Ali from Bournemouth University addresses the issue of Digital Addiction (DA) as a growing societal concern. The paper emphasizes that despite its widespread socio-economic implications, DA has not been sufficiently integrated into the software engineering field, particularly in requirements engineering, unlike traditional addiction domains such as drugs, gambling, and alcohol​.

To explore the potential research impacts of this study, I will outline its relevance using the research impact dimensions drawn from the frameworks in the knowledge base and the attached documents.

1. Academic Impact
The study contributes significantly to the academic domain by introducing DA as a first-class concept in software and requirements engineering. This presents a new area of inquiry for software engineers to consider the implications of software design on user behavior. The empirical investigation and proposed mind-map of DA causes offer a novel framework for further research, which could lead to advancements in software development methods that mitigate harmful digital behavior​​.

Potential Impacts:

The framework and methodologies proposed can be expanded by researchers in fields like Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, and Behavioral Science.
New studies on how software features promote DA, leading to more focused research on behavioral design patterns and their psychological effects.
2. Societal Impact
The societal impact of this study is profound. DA affects individuals' social, physical, and psychological well-being, which can lead to reduced productivity, strained relationships, and mental health issues. By addressing DA through requirements engineering, this research could help shape public policy, influence social norms around digital device usage, and promote healthier interaction patterns with technology​​.

Potential Impacts:

Behavioral Change: This research might lead to the development of guidelines or interventions that can reduce addictive digital behaviors, promoting better mental health and societal well-being​.
Policy Influence: The findings could influence policymakers to establish regulations around software design to prevent DA, similar to how laws govern the production and sale of addictive substances​​.
3. Technological Advancement and Commercialization
From a technological perspective, this study introduces the need for new design principles and technological frameworks that prevent DA. Companies involved in software development, particularly in gaming, social media, and mobile applications, could adopt these frameworks to create more ethical software products that prioritize user well-being over addictive features​​.

Potential Impacts:

The research can inspire the creation of software development tools and methodologies that track and mitigate addictive features during the design phase​.
Commercial products designed with these principles in mind could appeal to a growing market of ethically conscious consumers, potentially leading to a new category of digital products that prioritize ethical engagement​.
4. Health and Well-being Impact
Digital addiction is closely linked to deteriorating mental and physical health. By addressing it from a software engineering standpoint, this research could lead to improved clinical practices in diagnosing and managing digital addiction, perhaps leading to the development of new therapeutic tools or interventions​​.

Potential Impacts:

The study could help in creating therapeutic software tools designed specifically to monitor and control digital usage, contributing to better mental health outcomes.
Collaborations with healthcare professionals could foster new interdisciplinary methods to prevent and treat DA.
5. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
The economic implications of DA are substantial, with productivity losses and healthcare costs associated with addiction. This research could lead to reduced societal costs if DA is mitigated through better-designed software systems. Additionally, businesses could see an economic return from ethical software practices that reduce DA and thus improve the overall well-being of their user base, leading to more sustainable, long-term engagement​​.

Potential Impacts:

Reduced economic costs due to lower addiction-related health interventions.
Increased profitability for companies that market themselves as socially responsible by adopting ethical software design.
6. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The interdisciplinary nature of this research touches on psychology, sociology, software engineering, and public health, offering insights relevant across many sectors. As digital addiction is a global issue, the research has international implications, particularly in countries where technology use is deeply embedded in daily life​​.

Potential Impacts:

It could foster international collaborations to tackle DA on a global scale, with applications across various sectors such as education, healthcare, and industry​.
The research could lead to cross-disciplinary conferences and initiatives that combine efforts from software developers, psychologists, and policy experts to create a holistic approach to combating DA.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
This study promotes the ethical design of software, encouraging developers to move away from harmful, profit-driven addictive design features. It aligns with broader movements toward sustainable and ethically responsible technology development​​.

Potential Impacts:

Encouraging the tech industry to adopt sustainable and ethically sound practices, leading to the development of healthier digital environments.
The research can drive a new ethical discourse in software development that parallels the ethical standards in industries such as healthcare and biotechnology.
In summary, this study offers a broad spectrum of potential research impacts, from advancing academic understanding to influencing policy, promoting ethical software development, and enhancing global health outcomes. It touches upon various dimensions of impact, including societal well-being, technological innovation, and cross-disciplinary relevance, making it a cornerstone for future developments in mitigating digital addiction.
