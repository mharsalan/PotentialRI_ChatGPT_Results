3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Healthcare providers, including psychologists and pediatricians, who utilize the findings to provide better care. Educators and school systems also directly benefit from implementing the proposed accommodations.
Indirect Stakeholders: Families of children with DMD benefit from the improved mental health and social outcomes of the children. Society at large benefits from increased awareness and improved public health and education systems.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study offers deep insights into the neuropsychological effects of DMD and introduces specific interventions, making a significant contribution to pediatric neuropsychology and special education.
Broad Impact: The research has broad implications across multiple domains, influencing healthcare, education, and social policy by promoting a more holistic approach to managing DMD and similar conditions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The interventions proposed can be scaled up to reach more children with DMD across different regions or countries, expanding access to mental health care and educational support.
Transferability: The findings are transferable to other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or ADHD, meaning the proposed interventions could be adapted for broader use.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The research introduces innovative psychosocial interventions tailored to DMD patients, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques and specialized educational accommodations.
Disruption: It disrupts traditional healthcare models by integrating more psychosocial and educational support into the medical treatment of children with genetic disorders, fostering a more comprehensive care approach.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The focus on long-term follow-up and ongoing support systems ensures the research promotes sustainable care strategies for children with chronic neurodevelopmental conditions.
Ethical Considerations: The research aligns with ethical standards by addressing the mental health needs of vulnerable populations, ensuring fair and equitable access to necessary healthcare and education services.
8. Implementation and Usability
The interventions and accommodations recommended in the study are highly implementable in both clinical and educational settings, making them usable by healthcare providers, educators, and social workers.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research crosses disciplinary boundaries by integrating knowledge from psychology, pediatrics, education, and social work to provide a holistic approach to managing DMD.
Global Relevance: The findings are relevant worldwide, especially in countries with limited healthcare resources for managing rare genetic disorders. The proposed interventions could be adopted globally to improve the care of children with DMD.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study emphasizes resilience in managing chronic conditions, promoting interventions that can adapt to the changing needs of children with DMD as they grow, ensuring long-term relevance and adaptability.
11. Knowledge Dissemination and Communication

12. Capacity Building and Training
The study offers potential for capacity building by training healthcare professionals and educators in the recommended interventions, fostering expertise in managing DMD and similar conditions.
13. Health and Well-being Impact
The primary impact of this research lies in its contribution to improving the health and well-being of children with DMD through better mental health care and educational accommodations.
14. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
While not directly addressed in the study, improving the health and education outcomes for children with DMD could reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve workforce participation of family caregivers, yielding economic benefits.
15. Social and Cultural Impact
The research may contribute to changing societal perceptions of children with chronic neurodevelopmental conditions, promoting inclusivity and reducing stigma.
16. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
The study provides actionable insights for improving clinical practice in pediatric neuropsychology and suggests changes to healthcare delivery that can enhance the care experience for families dealing with DMD.
By addressing these dimensions, the study has the potential to generate a wide-ranging impact across various sectors, improving both individual outcomes for patients and broader systemic changes in healthcare, education, and social services.
