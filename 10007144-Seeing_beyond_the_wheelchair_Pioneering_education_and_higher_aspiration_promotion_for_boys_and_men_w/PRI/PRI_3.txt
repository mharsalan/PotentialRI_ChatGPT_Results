After reviewing the study on "Aspiration, austerity and ableism: to what extent are the 2014 SEND reforms supporting young people with a life-limiting impairment and their families to get the lives they want?" and aligning it with the research impact dimensions and tools, here are the potential research impacts of this study:

1. Academic Impact
The study contributes significantly to academic understanding of the challenges faced by families with children who have life-limiting conditions like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It advances discourse in special educational needs (SEN) research, particularly how austerity and neoliberal policies shape educational outcomes for vulnerable groups. By addressing the gaps in SEND reform, the research is poised to influence future academic studies on disability, education, and healthcare​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).

2. Social Impact
The study addresses social inequalities exacerbated by austerity, offering insights into how social policies impact disabled individuals and their families. By shedding light on how government funding cuts compromise essential support for these children, the study can lead to greater awareness and advocacy efforts for more inclusive and supportive social welfare systems​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
A key impact of this research is its potential to influence policy reforms. By evaluating the effectiveness of the 2014 SEND reforms, the study could prompt policymakers to reconsider the implementation of support systems for students with life-limiting impairments, possibly leading to policy adjustments that ensure more equitable access to services​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

4. Health and Well-being Impact
The study indirectly impacts health outcomes by highlighting how inadequate support from educational and healthcare systems worsens the quality of life for children with DMD. Improvements in policy and support structures based on this research could lead to better health management and well-being for these individuals and their families​(Research Impact Knowled…).

5. Economic Impact
Although not the primary focus, the study hints at the economic implications of austerity-driven policies. By showing how cuts in public spending for special education and healthcare services affect long-term care, the research could influence economic discussions around the allocation of resources for vulnerable populations, potentially leading to more sustainable investments in SEND services​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

6. Cultural and Social Impact
The study challenges prevailing ableist attitudes embedded in educational systems and policies. It promotes a cultural shift towards recognizing the rights of disabled individuals to a fulfilling life, advocating for societal change in how disability is perceived and treated​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

7. Educational Impact
The research has profound implications for the educational domain, particularly in reforming how schools and educators support children with severe impairments. By advocating for tailored, person-centered approaches, the study could influence curriculum design, teacher training, and educational policies aimed at fostering inclusive environments for disabled students​(Common Research Impact …).

8. Long-term Impact
The study may also have a long-term impact by influencing both academic and policy debates on disability and education reforms. Over time, the findings could contribute to more sustained and widespread reforms that ensure long-term improvements in the quality of life for disabled children​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).

9. Behavioral Change
The research highlights the need for better training and understanding among educators, policymakers, and service providers. If disseminated effectively, this study could encourage behavioral change in how professionals approach SEND education and services, leading to more empathy-driven and equitable care for individuals with life-limiting conditions​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).

10. Technological Adoption
While not explicitly about technology, the study could influence future discussions on how assistive technologies could better support disabled students in education and healthcare settings. By identifying gaps in current provisions, the study might encourage investment in innovative tools that can aid learning and mobility for children with conditions like DMD​(Research Impact Knowled…).

11. Equity and Inclusivity
The study advocates for greater equity in access to educational and healthcare services, particularly for marginalized groups affected by life-limiting conditions. The findings support initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in care and education for disabled individuals, pushing for policies that promote inclusivity​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).

12. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Although focused on UK policies, the findings are relevant globally, especially in countries facing similar challenges with austerity and neoliberal policies. The study's insights into disability, education, and healthcare can be transferred to different contexts and countries, fostering international collaboration on improving care for individuals with severe impairments​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).

13. Public Awareness and Education
Through its critical analysis of SEND reforms and austerity, the study has the potential to raise public awareness about the needs and rights of children with life-limiting impairments. By engaging with public discourse, the research can contribute to a shift in societal attitudes towards disability and the importance of providing adequate support​(Research Impact Knowled…).

14. Implementation and Usability
The study provides practical insights into the gaps in current SEND reforms, offering usable data that can help guide future implementation of policies aimed at improving support for disabled students. Policymakers and educators can apply the findings to refine service delivery, making the research highly implementable​(Research impact toolkit).

These impacts reflect the broad scope of influence this study could exert across multiple domains, including policy reform, social change, healthcare improvement, and academic discourse. The study’s alignment with key research impact dimensions ensures that it contributes meaningfully to both societal well-being and academic advancement.
