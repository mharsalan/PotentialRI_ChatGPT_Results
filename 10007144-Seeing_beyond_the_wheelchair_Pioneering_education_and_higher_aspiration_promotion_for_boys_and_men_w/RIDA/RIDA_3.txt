To analyze the research paper titled "Aspiration, austerity and ableism: to what extent are the 2014 SEND reforms supporting young people with a life-limiting impairment and their families to get the lives they want?" by Janet Hoskin based on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, I have extracted and mapped relevant findings as per the research impact framework.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The study examines the impact of the 2014 Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) reforms on young people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), focusing on the challenges these individuals face in achieving the lives they want due to austerity and neoliberal policies. The research addresses both social and educational domains, highlighting how families must navigate austerity, funding cuts, and a lack of tailored support within education systems. (Introduction, p. 266-268).

Page Reference: Introduction, p. 266-268.
Example: The research highlights how austerity measures have weakened the support systems for children with life-limiting conditions like DMD, affecting their social inclusion and access to quality education.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The findings underscore both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short term, the 2014 reforms brought about changes that were seen as promising, with immediate improvements in person-centered planning and increased satisfaction among some families. However, in the long-term, austerity and reduced funding threaten to undermine these gains, creating barriers to achieving sustained improvements for individuals with DMD. (Findings, p. 269-270).

Page Reference: Findings, p. 269-270.
Example: Short-term improvements included better satisfaction rates in pilot areas, but long-term impacts suggest ongoing struggles for sustained support due to systemic austerity and funding limitations.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The study identifies direct stakeholders as young people with DMD, their families, schools, and indirect stakeholders as healthcare professionals, policymakers, and community support services. The research provides insights for policymakers aiming to improve the efficacy of SEND reforms and for educational institutions tasked with supporting these students. (Discussion, p. 272).

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 272.
Example: Direct beneficiaries include students with DMD and their families, while policymakers and local authorities are crucial stakeholders in ensuring effective SEND support implementation.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
The research has deep impact in the field of special education policy by providing specific insights into how austerity affects support for students with life-limiting impairments. Its broad impact is seen in how the findings may influence future reforms across different regions and potentially guide policy changes on a national level. (Findings, p. 273-274).

Page Reference: Findings, p. 273-274.
Example: The study deeply influences special education policy reform discussions, but it also has broad implications for wider educational policy, particularly concerning austerity’s role in limiting the support for life-limiting impairments.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
The research suggests that lessons from the 2014 SEND reforms could be scaled and transferred to other regions or countries facing similar challenges in supporting children with life-limiting conditions, particularly in the face of austerity. There is potential for the findings to influence policies beyond the UK. (Discussion, p. 270-271).

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 270-271.
Example: The insights on how austerity impacts support systems for SEND students can be transferred to other countries facing similar financial constraints, and scaled to develop international policies for supporting children with life-limiting conditions.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
While the 2014 SEND reforms introduced innovative person-centered approaches, the study argues that these reforms are not disruptive enough to address the structural challenges posed by austerity. The innovation lies in shifting the focus to outcomes and employment opportunities, but systemic barriers persist. (Discussion, p. 270).

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 270.
Example: The introduction of Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans is innovative but not disruptive enough to fully overcome the austerity-driven funding cuts and bureaucratic hurdles.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
The research raises ethical concerns regarding how austerity disproportionately impacts children with severe impairments, questioning whether the SEND reforms are sustainable given the lack of adequate funding and resources. (Findings, p. 271).

Page Reference: Findings, p. 271.
Example: Ethical concerns are highlighted by the disparity in support for wealthier regions versus those suffering from austerity, and the sustainability of the reforms is questioned in the context of ongoing financial cuts.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
The study reports mixed outcomes in the implementation of the reforms. While some regions showed positive feedback during the trial phases, others struggled with delays and insufficient resources, affecting the usability of the new system in practice. (Discussion, p. 272-273).

Page Reference: Discussion, p. 272-273.
Example: Implementation challenges, such as lack of coordination between services, made the reforms less usable for some families, limiting their potential benefits.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
The research touches on themes of social policy, education, and healthcare, demonstrating its cross-disciplinary relevance. The findings may also have global relevance, especially for countries facing austerity measures that impact their ability to provide comprehensive SEND support. (Introduction, p. 266-268).

Page Reference: Introduction, p. 266-268.
Example: The study’s exploration of austerity’s impact on SEND systems has implications for global education and social policy, particularly in regions with similarly strained public services.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
The resilience of families and students with DMD is highlighted in the study, as they continue to fight for necessary support despite the challenges imposed by austerity. However, the adaptability of the SEND reforms is questioned, given their limited success in a financial climate of reduced resources. (Findings, p. 274-275).

Page Reference: Findings, p. 274-275.
Example: Families demonstrate resilience in navigating a complex and underfunded system, but the reforms lack the adaptability required to meet the needs of children with severe disabilities in an austerity-driven context.

This detailed breakdown of research impact dimensions provides a comprehensive view of the study's contributions and challenges across various domains.
