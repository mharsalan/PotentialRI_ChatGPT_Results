Based on the research article "Troubling norms? Adults and teenagers with a life-limiting impairment in Denmark and England talk about their lives, support, and future plans" by Janet Hoskin, I will map the findings onto the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

The study crosses multiple domains, including social, healthcare, and educational domains by addressing the societal and healthcare systems’ support for individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and their transition into adulthood.
“Findings identified three key themes: the existence of normative goals; expertise from lived experience, and the meaning of independence for someone with a complex impairment” (Results, page 333-335)​(4).
Example:

Social Domain: The research highlights the social marginalization experienced by young people with DMD in England, contrasting it with better support structures in Denmark​(4). This could drive policy reforms in the UK to better integrate social support services for young adults with disabilities.
Health Domain: It discusses how medical and non-medical factors influence the life expectancy and quality of life for people with DMD in Denmark and England​(4).
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

“With treatments including cardiac monitoring and ventilation, many men are living longer and some into their thirties and forties.” (Introduction, page 330-331)​(4).
“Despite improved prognosis for men with DMD due to treatment such as ventilation, young adults across the world are still often described as marginalised and unanticipated.” (Introduction, page 331)​(4).
Example:

Long-term Impact: The study provides insights into the long-term effects of improved healthcare interventions, such as ventilation, on the life expectancy of DMD patients. These findings could lay the groundwork for ongoing research into quality of life improvements and social integration of individuals with life-limiting impairments over time​(4).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpts:

"Findings from the focus groups in England suggested that young people with DMD are not being supported to have normalized expectations for their lives" (Findings, page 334)​(4).
Example:

Direct Stakeholders: Individuals with DMD, healthcare providers, social workers, and educational institutions are directly impacted as the research aims to inform better support systems and care protocols in transitioning these individuals into adulthood​(4).
Indirect Stakeholders: Families and communities indirectly benefit through better integration of individuals with DMD into societal frameworks, enabling better social outcomes​(4).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts:

“The study explores normative goals, lived experience, and independence among adults and teenagers with DMD” (Findings, page 333)​(4).
Example:

Deep Impact: The study has a significant impact on disability studies and special needs education, providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by people with DMD.
Broad Impact: Beyond the DMD community, these insights could be applied to individuals with other life-limiting conditions, influencing healthcare policies and disability support frameworks internationally​(4).
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts:

“The experience of adulthood in Denmark has been reported as positive in literature, whereas Transition to Adulthood in England has been described as poor and lacking in expectation” (Results, page 334-335)​(4).
Example:

Scalability: The Danish model of care for people with DMD, particularly in providing personal assistants and promoting social integration, could be scaled and applied in other countries, including England, to improve the quality of life for DMD patients​(4).
Transferability: The findings on post-humanism and 'disHuman' thinking could be transferred to broader disability studies, influencing policies on autonomy and independence across various disabilities​(4).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts:

The research introduces the concept of “disHumanism,” challenging traditional notions of humanism that emphasize autonomy and independence (Findings, page 332-333)​(4).
Example:

Disruption: The study disrupts traditional healthcare and disability models by challenging the normative benchmarks of independence and autonomy for individuals with complex impairments like DMD​(4). This has the potential to change how support systems for disabled individuals are conceptualized globally.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts:

The paper emphasizes "lived experience" as a key aspect of healthcare practice in Denmark, where individuals with DMD shape medical decisions regarding their care (Findings, page 336-337)​(4).
Example:

Ethical Considerations: The study raises ethical issues related to the autonomy and dignity of people with DMD, particularly regarding decisions like invasive ventilation. It advocates for their voices to be heard in medical and social decisions, aligning with ethical principles of patient autonomy and respect​(4).
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts:

“Services in England may not be supporting young people with DMD to access appropriate support that can enable them to strive for or achieve normative goals” (Findings, page 334)​(4).
Example:

Usability: The study’s insights into how healthcare and social services in Denmark better support individuals with DMD could be implemented in English healthcare and social service systems to improve the usability of these services​(4).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts:

“Comparing the findings from structured conversations with members of the DMD community in Denmark and England” (Introduction, page 331)​(4).
Example:

Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research combines elements from sociology, healthcare, and education, making it highly relevant for interdisciplinary studies on disability and social integration. It can influence policies across healthcare, education, and social services globally​(4).
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts:

"Adults in Denmark have reported a good quality of life with an optimal health care programme and generous social care, whereas adults with DMD in England have reported poor transition to adulthood planning" (Introduction, page 330)​(4).
Example:

Resilience: The research illustrates how the Danish system’s adaptable and responsive approach to DMD care has fostered greater resilience among individuals with DMD, enabling them to live more fulfilling lives compared to their counterparts in England​(4).
These dimensions provide a comprehensive assessment of the research's potential impact across various domains.
