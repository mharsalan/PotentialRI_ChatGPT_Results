After thoroughly reviewing the study titled "Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence on the True Local Welfare Costs of Forest Conservation in Madagascar: Are Discrete Choice Experiments a Valid ex ante Tool?" and aligning it with research impact dimensions, I can identify a range of potential research impacts that this study might achieve. Below is a comprehensive list of impacts organized according to the major Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Academic Impact
Advancing Knowledge: This study contributes significantly to the field of environmental economics, policy analysis, and conservation science, particularly by investigating the welfare impacts of conservation in low-income settings through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs). The novel combination of qualitative and quantitative methods improves our understanding of how conservation efforts affect local livelihoods.
Example: The research offers important lessons for future academic studies on ex-ante policy assessments, specifically the use of DCEs to estimate welfare costs in developing countries​(3)​(Common Research Impact …).
Influencing Further Research: The research encourages future studies on REDD+ social safeguards, compensation strategies, and their efficacy in low-income settings. It may inspire interdisciplinary research that integrates socio-economic welfare analysis with conservation policy evaluations​(impact pathway).
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Shaping Conservation Policies: The research offers actionable insights into how REDD+ projects can be designed to better accommodate local socio-economic realities. Policymakers can use the findings to develop compensation mechanisms that ensure conservation-imposed restrictions do not unduly harm local communities.
Example: The study directly informs conservation policy design, emphasizing the need to rethink compensation strategies for rural households that rely on forest resources​(3)​(Research impact toolkit).
Influencing Global Conservation Practices: The research highlights significant gaps in current compensation practices for local communities in conservation projects, which could influence international organizations (such as the UN or the World Bank) to adopt better social safeguards and equity measures in their environmental programs​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Social and Cultural Impact
Improving Local Livelihoods: By assessing the true welfare costs of conservation, this research provides a foundation for better social justice in conservation efforts. The findings could lead to improved livelihoods for local communities by ensuring they are adequately compensated for the restrictions placed on their resource use.
Example: Communities affected by forest conservation efforts may experience improved economic outcomes if policies adjust based on the study’s findings, ensuring compensation is fair and sufficient​(Research impact toolkit).
Raising Public Awareness: The study’s findings on the inequitable impacts of conservation efforts could raise public awareness about the social costs of environmental policies, influencing media coverage and public debates on sustainable and just conservation practices​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Economic Impact
Fair Compensation Mechanisms: The study’s analysis of welfare costs could lead to the design of economically viable compensation schemes that address the financial losses suffered by local communities due to conservation restrictions. This could help ensure that environmental policies are economically sustainable for all stakeholders.
Example: The research could influence the allocation of financial resources for compensation in REDD+ and other conservation projects, ensuring that economic costs to local communities are factored into budgetary considerations​(impact pathway).
5. Environmental Impact
Sustainable Conservation Practices: The study emphasizes that conservation strategies need to balance both environmental and social goals, ensuring that local communities are part of the solution rather than being marginalized by environmental initiatives. This could lead to more sustainable conservation practices that incorporate local knowledge and socio-economic contexts​(impact pathway).
Example: By improving compensation models, conservation projects might achieve better long-term success, as local communities become more engaged and supportive of environmental goals​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Relevance Across Fields: The study’s cross-disciplinary approach integrates insights from environmental science, social policy, and economics, making it highly relevant to global conservation efforts and development economics. It addresses how local and global environmental policies intersect with social justice and equity issues.
Example: The study is globally relevant, particularly for developing countries where conservation policies and economic challenges often collide​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovating Policy Assessment Tools: By testing the validity of DCEs in predicting welfare impacts, the study introduces a more refined tool for ex-ante policy assessments, especially in low-income and rural settings. This could disrupt how impact assessments are conducted in conservation and development projects globally.
Example: The use of DCEs to predict the socio-economic outcomes of conservation projects could become a new standard for assessing welfare impacts in environmental policy​(3)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Disrupting Traditional Compensation Models: The research challenges traditional compensation approaches in conservation projects by showing that current models are insufficient and often do not account for the true economic costs to local communities​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Promoting Ethical Conservation: The study promotes ethical conservation practices by emphasizing the need for fair compensation to local communities affected by forest conservation. It highlights the importance of ethical decision-making in balancing global environmental goals with the needs of vulnerable populations.
Example: Ethical considerations raised by the study could lead to revisions in conservation ethics frameworks, ensuring that local communities are not disadvantaged by conservation efforts​(Common Research Impact …).
9. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study’s findings and methods can be scaled up to other regions facing similar challenges with conservation and development. The tools and recommendations provided could be adapted for use in other developing countries implementing REDD+ projects or similar conservation initiatives​(Common Research Impact …).
Transferability: The approach used in this study, particularly the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, can be transferred to other sectors dealing with environmental sustainability and community impacts (such as infrastructure development or land-use planning)​(impact pathway).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Building Resilient Conservation Policies: The research provides a framework for developing resilient conservation strategies that are adaptable to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions. By incorporating local welfare concerns, the study contributes to the creation of policies that can withstand future challenges, including economic instability and environmental degradation​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Example: Conservation projects informed by this research may be better equipped to adapt to new economic realities or shifts in community needs​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Conclusion:
This study has the potential to make significant contributions across academic, policy, social, economic, and environmental domains. It challenges traditional approaches to conservation, particularly in developing contexts, by advocating for fair and equitable treatment of local populations affected by global environmental initiatives.
