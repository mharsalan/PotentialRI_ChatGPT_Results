After reviewing the full content of the study "Global No Net Loss of Natural Ecosystems" and cross-referencing with predefined instructions and knowledge of research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Environmental Impact: The study has a profound impact on environmental conservation by proposing a global framework for "No Net Loss" (NNL) of ecosystems, directly influencing policies to preserve natural habitats and biodiversity.
Policy Impact: The study offers a framework to be integrated into national and international policies, particularly under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It encourages the development of country-specific conservation strategies based on ecosystem depletion and restoration needs.
Socio-economic Impact: The study considers the socio-economic development of low-HDI countries, advocating for policies that balance conservation with human development. This could lead to policy adjustments in sectors such as agriculture, urban development, and resource management.
Global Health: Ecosystem preservation has indirect but significant implications for global health by protecting ecosystem services that benefit human health, such as clean water, air, and food security.
Academic Domain: The research provides a methodological foundation for future ecological studies and policies related to biodiversity and ecosystem management.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Short-Term Impact: In the near term, this study influences ongoing policy discussions, such as those leading up to the 2020 Conference of the Parties (COP) for the CBD. It also provides immediate guidance for countries to structure their conservation strategies.
Long-Term Impact: Over the long term, this study sets a foundation for global conservation efforts until at least 2030. It proposes sustainable goals for ecosystem restoration and preservation that could shape international environmental policies for decades.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Policymakers: Governments and international organizations, particularly those involved in biodiversity conservation, benefit directly from the study by using its framework to shape conservation policies and legal frameworks.
Conservation Organizations: NGOs and global bodies like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) can implement the study’s findings to set conservation priorities and fund restoration efforts.
Indigenous Communities and Local Populations: Communities living in or near protected areas could be involved in ecosystem restoration projects, benefiting economically and socially while preserving their local environments.
International Development Agencies: Agencies like the World Bank or the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) may use the study's framework to design projects balancing environmental conservation and economic development.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Depth of Impact: The study deeply influences environmental science and conservation policies. Its methodological innovations, such as distinguishing between Managed Net Loss and Net Gain, create new paradigms for how countries approach ecosystem conservation.
Breadth of Impact: Its interdisciplinary nature means it impacts not only conservationists but also policymakers, social scientists, and economists. It provides broad implications across sectors like agriculture, forestry, and urban planning.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Scalability: The framework is designed to be scalable from local ecosystems to global conservation efforts. Countries can apply it to both national and regional ecosystems, creating scalable policies and conservation strategies.
Transferability: The research’s concepts can be transferred across ecosystems—applicable to both terrestrial and marine environments—and adapted to different socio-economic and political contexts.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Innovation: The study introduces new ways of thinking about conservation, notably the concept of Managed Net Loss for countries with high economic development needs. This innovation aligns conservation with development goals, making it more palatable for policymakers in developing regions.
Disruption: It challenges the traditional conservation paradigm, which often focuses on strict preservation, by offering a more flexible approach that includes restoration and limited loss. This can disrupt current conservation strategies and lead to more dynamic approaches in policy and on-the-ground projects.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Sustainability: The research advocates for sustainable conservation practices that ensure no further loss of ecosystems while allowing for human development. It emphasizes the ethical need to balance environmental sustainability with social and economic progress, particularly for countries with fewer resources.
Ethical Impact: By promoting equitable contributions to global conservation efforts, it raises awareness of the need for fairness in global environmental agreements, ensuring that all nations can contribute based on their capacity.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Implementation: Policymakers can directly implement the framework in their national biodiversity strategies, while international bodies can incorporate it into broader conservation goals. Its usability is evident in its practical recommendations for countries to assess their ecosystem status and align conservation with development needs.
Usability: The study's methodologies are designed to be used by governments, NGOs, and conservation scientists to assess ecosystem health and formulate restoration targets.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study integrates environmental science, economics, and social development, making it relevant across disciplines and globally applicable. It addresses the complex interaction between biodiversity conservation, human development, and policy.
Global Relevance: It provides a globally applicable framework that can be adapted by nations across different geographic regions, ecosystems, and economic conditions, making it highly relevant for international conservation policies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Resilience: The framework is resilient in that it allows for flexible, country-specific strategies that can adapt to changing socio-economic conditions and environmental pressures. It promotes long-term ecosystem sustainability by providing guidelines for ecosystem restoration and preventing future degradation.
Adaptability: The approach can be adapted to new and emerging conservation challenges, such as climate change, by modifying national contributions to reflect changing environmental conditions or economic imperatives.
These potential impacts demonstrate the broad and transformative effects of the study on both conservation efforts and international policy frameworks​(6)​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
