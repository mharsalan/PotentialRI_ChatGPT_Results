To assess the research impact of the provided study across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," I will break down each dimension using details from the text you've shared. Here’s a dimension-by-dimension evaluation with excerpts, page references, and examples from the research paper.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The study on biodiversity offsets, particularly in Madagascar, influences both environmental and policy domains by addressing the impacts of industrial activities on biodiversity and incorporating local livelihood concerns. It challenges the assumption that biodiversity offsets are universally beneficial, highlighting their local economic and social costs.
Example: "Biodiversity offset programmes... deliver no net loss and preferably a net gain of biodiversity" (Results, p.44).
Page Reference: Results, page 44.
Example: This research affects environmental conservation by proposing improvements to biodiversity offset strategies that consider local costs, thus influencing policy decisions about biodiversity conservation in developing regions.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The paper’s focus on biodiversity offset standards can have both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term impacts may include changes to current practices of biodiversity offsetting, while long-term impacts relate to the adoption of policies that balance environmental protection with social justice.
Example: "We suggest that the gap between progressive policies... and their implementation" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: In the short term, this research can prompt revisions to international conservation policies, while in the long term, it may shape global standards on biodiversity offsets, particularly for developing nations.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: The research identifies multiple stakeholders, including local communities, policymakers, conservationists, and corporations. It emphasizes the importance of considering the local people affected by biodiversity offsets.
Example: "Impacts on these people should be considered and mitigated" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: Local communities in biodiversity-rich regions, government policymakers, and international conservation bodies are all key stakeholders who would benefit from more equitable biodiversity conservation policies.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study deeply impacts the field of biodiversity conservation by critiquing the current standards and practices, pushing for better integration of social and economic dimensions into environmental conservation projects.
Example: "The gap between excellent progressive policies... and the implementation of these policies" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: The research deeply influences policy implementation within the biodiversity conservation sector, while its broader impact spans across development economics and environmental policy.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The insights into improving biodiversity offset implementation can be scaled up to apply to other low-income countries and regions facing similar conservation and development challenges.
Example: "Impacts of biodiversity offsets on local people... suggest that the case is not isolated" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: The research's findings are highly scalable and transferable to similar projects globally, especially where biodiversity offsets are tied to large infrastructure projects in developing countries.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: This research introduces innovative critiques of the current biodiversity offset practices, challenging the prevailing notion that offsets are inherently positive for all stakeholders.
Example: "Biodiversity offset programmes... claim no local costs of establishing the biodiversity offsets" (Results, p.45).
Page Reference: Results, page 45.
Example: By exposing the social and economic costs of biodiversity offsets, the study disrupts the current model of conservation in low-income countries, prompting a shift toward more socially inclusive models.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: The research directly addresses ethical issues by questioning the fairness of biodiversity offsets and their impacts on vulnerable communities who rely on natural resources.
Example: "Impacts on these people should be considered and mitigated" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: It contributes to sustainable practices by advocating for offsets that do not impose undue costs on local communities, ensuring that biodiversity conservation aligns with broader ethical standards of equity and justice.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The study identifies a clear implementation gap between policy and practice in biodiversity offsets, suggesting improvements for usability in low-income countries.
Example: "We offer recommendations for how the implementation of biodiversity offsets can be improved" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: The recommendations for better policy implementation are practical and applicable for governments and NGOs working on biodiversity conservation projects in developing regions.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study is cross-disciplinary, integrating insights from ecology, development studies, and social sciences to critique biodiversity offsets. It is globally relevant due to the increasing implementation of these offsets in developing countries.
Example: "Biodiversity offsets are increasingly being established in low-income countries" (Results, p.45).
Page Reference: Results, page 45.
Example: The research is globally significant, as biodiversity offsetting is a common conservation strategy used in infrastructure projects worldwide, particularly in developing regions with high biodiversity and economic challenges.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The study encourages a more resilient and adaptable approach to biodiversity offsets, focusing on the need to adapt policies to better meet the needs of local communities.
Example: "The implementation of biodiversity offsets can be improved" (Discussion, p.47).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 47.
Example: By advocating for biodiversity policies that can adapt to local social and economic contexts, the research enhances the resilience of conservation strategies to better withstand economic and social pressures.
This dimension-based analysis highlights the broad impact of the study across various fields, suggesting that its findings could lead to significant policy changes and improvements in biodiversity conservation practices, particularly in developing countries​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
