Based on the text in the provided file, here’s a detailed breakdown of the Research Impact Dimensions for the study in question, aligned with predefined instructions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Impact: This research contributes significantly to the academic domain, particularly in the fields of environmental science, conservation, and social impact assessment. The study highlights the intertwined positive and negative social impacts of biodiversity offset projects, providing new insights into the socio-economic implications of conservation policies.
Example: The study's findings can advance knowledge on conservation policies and biodiversity offsets, influencing future academic discourse on how these conservation strategies affect local communities.
Environmental Domain: The research addresses biodiversity conservation, focusing on reducing the negative environmental impacts of large-scale developments like mining, which is critical in promoting sustainable development practices.
Example: It provides a nuanced understanding of how conservation projects may affect ecosystem services such as water availability, linking environmental outcomes with human well-being.
Policy Domain: The research has implications for policymakers involved in creating and regulating biodiversity offsets, particularly in low-income countries where these projects are becoming increasingly common.
Example: "Our findings suggest that biodiversity offset policies must consider the economic and social impacts on local communities" (p.47)​(2).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Short-term Impact: The study's findings on the social impacts of biodiversity offsets could prompt immediate policy adjustments or improvements in the implementation of current biodiversity projects.
Example: "The conservation restrictions were perceived to negatively impact basic material for a good life and freedom of choice and action" (p.47)​(2). This could lead to short-term changes in how companies like Ambatovy engage with local communities.
Long-term Impact: In the long run, the research can shape broader conservation strategies and how multinational companies approach biodiversity offsets in developing countries.
Example: The study’s insights may influence future research and policies designed to ensure that biodiversity offset projects are both environmentally and socially sustainable​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
Local communities: Directly impacted by biodiversity offsets, especially regarding changes in land use and access to natural resources.
Policymakers: Those responsible for crafting or modifying policies around biodiversity offsets can use the study to make informed decisions about project implementation.
Corporate stakeholders: Companies involved in large-scale industrial projects, such as Ambatovy, are key stakeholders who can apply these findings to improve community engagement and sustainable practices.
Indirect Stakeholders:
Environmental NGOs: Organizations advocating for sustainable conservation efforts would find the study’s insights useful in lobbying for more equitable conservation policies.
Academics and future researchers: The findings open avenues for further research into the social dimensions of conservation projects.
Example: "Villagers expressed concern about restrictions on land expansion, which they felt exacerbated existing pressure on agricultural productivity" (p.47)​(2).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: This research deeply impacts sustainable conservation practices and biodiversity management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. It challenges existing assumptions that biodiversity offsets have only positive outcomes, emphasizing the complex interplay between conservation and local livelihoods.
Breadth of Impact: The study’s findings extend beyond the environmental sector, touching on economic development, social justice, and policy reform, particularly in countries where infrastructure development is tied to conservation efforts.
Example: By integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, the research has broad implications for the fields of environmental justice and socio-economic development​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The findings from this research, specifically those related to policy recommendations for biodiversity offsets, can be scaled to larger projects across other developing countries.
Example: The research’s conclusions about the social impacts of biodiversity offsets in Madagascar can inform similar projects in countries like Brazil, India, and China, where offsets are being implemented as part of infrastructure development​(2).
Transferability: This study can be transferred to other contexts, such as large-scale agricultural or infrastructure projects in low-income countries, where conservation and development goals must be balanced.
Example: The conceptual framework applied in this research can be adapted for assessing the social impacts of other environmental projects globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces new insights into the often-overlooked social consequences of biodiversity offsets, advocating for a more holistic approach to conservation that includes social and economic dimensions alongside environmental objectives.
Example: The research’s combination of environmental conservation with social impact assessment offers a novel framework for evaluating the full range of impacts from biodiversity offsets​(2).
Disruption: The research challenges traditional views of biodiversity offsets as purely beneficial by revealing the significant social costs incurred by local populations, pushing for policy and practice changes in how these offsets are designed and implemented.
Example: "The conservation restrictions... were also seen as having both positive and negative impacts on security" (p.47)​(2).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study emphasizes the need for biodiversity offsets to be both environmentally and socially sustainable, advocating for projects that do not undermine local livelihoods.
Example: The study critiques current offset projects for creating disparities between those who bear the costs of conservation and those who benefit from it, particularly in rural areas where poverty is high​(2).
Ethical Considerations: The study touches on issues of environmental justice, focusing on the unequal distribution of costs and benefits from conservation projects, which raises ethical questions about the fairness of biodiversity offsets in developing regions.
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The research provides practical recommendations on how biodiversity offset projects can be better designed and implemented, with an emphasis on fair compensation for local communities and integrating social impacts into conservation planning.
Example: Recommendations include improved local stakeholder engagement and more equitable distribution of the benefits of conservation​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: Policymakers, conservation organizations, and companies involved in sustainable development can apply these insights to design and manage biodiversity offsets more effectively.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study is cross-disciplinary, drawing on environmental science, social science, and development economics to assess the full range of impacts of biodiversity offsets. It highlights the intersection between natural resource management and human well-being.
Example: It combines insights from environmental policy and rural development, making it relevant to scholars and practitioners across these fields.
Global Relevance: The research has relevance for international development and global conservation efforts, particularly in contexts where biodiversity hotspots overlap with areas of high poverty​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: By highlighting the social vulnerabilities introduced by biodiversity offsets, the research advocates for more resilient conservation models that adapt to local socio-economic contexts.
Adaptability: The findings can be adapted to other regions facing similar conservation-development trade-offs, making the study highly flexible in its application across different geographic and cultural contexts​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
