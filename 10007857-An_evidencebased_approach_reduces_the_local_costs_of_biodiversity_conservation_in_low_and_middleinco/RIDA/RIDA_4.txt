Based on the document excerpts and aligned with the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions, here is a detailed assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study titled "Can REDD+ Social Safeguards Reach the ‘Right’ People? Lessons from Madagascar".

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Academic Domain: This study significantly contributes to environmental science, social policy, and climate change mitigation. It critically evaluates the implementation of social safeguards within the REDD+ framework and offers important lessons on the socio-political dynamics of compensating communities affected by forest conservation.
Example: The research provides new insights into the social impacts of conservation programs and offers a framework for future research on equity in global climate policy​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(4).
Social Domain: The study emphasizes the social justice aspect of environmental interventions, focusing on how REDD+ programs can exacerbate inequalities in rural communities if not implemented equitably.
Example: By revealing the vulnerability of marginalized groups in accessing compensation, the study highlights the need for more inclusive social protection measures​(4).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: In the immediate term, this study can influence policy adjustments in REDD+ programs to ensure better identification and compensation of affected persons.
Example: Policymakers could revise safeguard processes to avoid elite capture and ensure that the most vulnerable households receive compensation​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the findings could shape global REDD+ projects, ensuring that social safeguards are more robust and systematically enforced in climate change mitigation strategies.
Example: This research could influence the design of future climate agreements that prioritize equitable distribution of benefits in conservation projects​(4).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
Local Communities: The study impacts forest-dependent communities by advocating for fairer compensation processes.
Policymakers: REDD+ project administrators and international organizations can directly apply the study’s recommendations to improve social safeguard assessments.
Indirect Stakeholders:
Global NGOs and advocacy groups working on climate justice and sustainable development will benefit from these insights to lobby for better protections for local communities in conservation projects​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The research deeply impacts the field of social safeguards in conservation, particularly in developing countries, where vulnerable populations are often overlooked in policy execution.
Example: The study critiques the processes used to assess affected persons in Madagascar, showing how reliance on local elites can distort compensation outcomes​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Breadth: It also has a broad impact on climate policy, social equity, and international development by influencing how future REDD+ projects are designed and evaluated globally​(4).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The findings from this study can be applied to other REDD+ projects globally, especially in regions where social inequalities are prevalent in the implementation of environmental policies.
Example: The recommendations for blanket compensation could be scaled to other countries implementing REDD+ programs, ensuring a more inclusive approach to identifying affected populations​(4).
Transferability: The research methods and findings are transferable to other contexts involving natural resource management and community compensation, including sectors like mining, infrastructure development, or tourism​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study innovates by combining qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the effectiveness of social safeguards, offering a more comprehensive understanding of how REDD+ projects impact local livelihoods.
Example: The research introduces new methodologies for evaluating social safeguards that can improve the rigor of future conservation projects​(4).
Disruption: It challenges the current risk-based approach to social safeguards in REDD+, which focuses on preventing harm without actively improving livelihoods, proposing instead a proactive approach to compensation​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study underscores the importance of integrating social sustainability into conservation efforts, ensuring that REDD+ programs do not unintentionally increase poverty or inequality.
Example: By advocating for blanket compensation, the research addresses the ethical challenges of elite capture and marginalization in social safeguard assessments​(4)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The study highlights the ethical dilemma of compensating only certain individuals while neglecting others equally affected, calling for more transparent and equitable compensation processes​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability: The research provides practical recommendations for improving REDD+ social safeguards by advocating for more comprehensive compensation assessments that reach marginalized households.
Example: Policymakers can directly apply the study’s suggestion to use blanket compensation in cases where identifying all affected households is difficult​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study bridges environmental science, social policy, and development economics, making it relevant to researchers and practitioners across these fields.
Example: The findings could inform not only climate mitigation strategies but also social justice and rural development policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The research has global implications for REDD+ implementation in various tropical countries, including regions in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where deforestation and inequality are closely linked​(4).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: By emphasizing the need for flexible compensation mechanisms, the study promotes resilience in both conservation strategies and local communities, ensuring that households can adapt to changing conservation policies and land-use restrictions.
Example: The study’s findings could help REDD+ projects build more adaptive frameworks that evolve to meet the socio-economic needs of local populations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Adaptability: The research methods and recommendations are adaptable to other climate mitigation and conservation initiatives that involve compensating local communities for restricted land access​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This analysis provides a detailed overview of how this research impacts various domains, while also highlighting its scalability, sustainability, and ethical considerations.
