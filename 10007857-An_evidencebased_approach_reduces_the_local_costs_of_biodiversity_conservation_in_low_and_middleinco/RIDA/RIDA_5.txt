Example: The findings could influence how future REDD+ projects allocate funds to minimize the economic burden on local communities​(5).
Environmental Domain: By evaluating the costs of conservation, this research helps in creating sustainable forest management policies that balance environmental benefits with social and economic fairness.
Example: The study informs sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 15 on life on land​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study offers immediate insights for policy makers involved in World Bank REDD+ programs and other conservation projects, providing data that can be used to adjust compensation schemes.
Example: Policymakers might quickly implement recommendations to improve fairness in compensation within conservation areas like CAZ​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the study’s use of DCEs and its findings on social safeguards will likely influence both academic discourse and policy frameworks on environmental governance, equity, and poverty alleviation.
Example: This research could form the basis for future studies on conservation equity, reshaping global frameworks for safeguards in protected areas​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Policymakers involved in conservation and REDD+ projects in Madagascar and globally, local communities dependent on forest resources, and NGOs focused on social justice in conservation.
Example: Direct beneficiaries include REDD+ administrators, local governments, and World Bank stakeholders responsible for social safeguards​(5).
Indirect Stakeholders: International organizations advocating for environmental justice, researchers studying conservation impacts, and potentially, global environmental funders like the World Bank and UN agencies.
Example: The findings could inform international organizations like UNFCCC about how REDD+ projects impact local livelihoods​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact: The research deeply impacts the field of environmental economics by providing a comprehensive assessment of the true economic costs faced by households due to conservation.
Example: The study's detailed analysis of household opportunity costs and compensation provides a deep insight into how conservation affects rural economies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Breadth of Impact: The research has broader implications across multiple sectors, including policy, development economics, and social justice. It can influence REDD+ projects in other tropical countries.
Example: Its findings could be applied to climate mitigation projects in other regions like Southeast Asia or Central Africa​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The methodology and findings can be scaled up to other REDD+ initiatives globally, helping inform compensation strategies in countries that depend on forest conservation as part of their climate commitments.
Example: This approach could be scaled up to assess the economic costs of conservation in other REDD+ regions, informing international climate policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The use of Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) for estimating opportunity costs can be transferred to other fields such as infrastructure projects, where local populations face displacement.
Example: DCE methodologies could be used in infrastructure development projects to evaluate the compensation required for displaced communities​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: This study innovates by using DCEs to estimate the opportunity costs of forest conservation, a rarely applied method in rural and low-literacy settings. Its findings challenge the current structure of social safeguards in REDD+ projects.
Example: The innovative application of DCEs could lead to a new standard for evaluating the economic impacts of conservation on local populations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: By highlighting the inequity in how compensation is distributed, the study disrupts the conventional narrative of conservation as a purely positive global good, calling for a rethink in compensation strategies.
Example: The recommendation for blanket compensation could disrupt existing REDD+ compensation models globally​(5).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The research promotes more sustainable conservation practices by ensuring that local communities, often the most vulnerable, are not disproportionately burdened by global conservation initiatives.
Example: The study’s call for more equitable compensation contributes to the sustainability of conservation projects by fostering community buy-in​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The study addresses the ethical issues surrounding conservation, particularly the need to ensure that global environmental gains do not come at the expense of the poorest local populations.
Example: It raises critical ethical questions about how global climate policies can unfairly disadvantage marginalized communities​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study's recommendations are highly implementable for policymakers and conservation managers, offering actionable suggestions for improving compensation frameworks under the World Bank’s social safeguards.
Example: Policymakers can use the study’s findings to revise REDD+ compensation policies to ensure that all affected communities are compensated fairly​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: The detailed cost analysis provides practical data that REDD+ project managers can directly apply when designing compensation packages for forest conservation.
Example: REDD+ projects in Madagascar and similar regions could use the study’s data on opportunity costs to guide compensation distribution​(5).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The research integrates insights from environmental science, economics, and social policy, making it relevant across multiple academic fields and practical domains.
Example: The study is relevant for development economists, environmental policymakers, and social scientists working on conservation-related displacement​(5).
