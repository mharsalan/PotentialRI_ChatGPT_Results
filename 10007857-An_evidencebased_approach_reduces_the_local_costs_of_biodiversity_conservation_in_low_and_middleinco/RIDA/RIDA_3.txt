Based on your request to assess the potential research impact dimensions for the study in detail, I have extracted relevant details from the uploaded file. Here is the analysis aligned with the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Domain: The study contributes significantly to environmental economics and conservation policy, particularly in understanding the welfare costs of forest conservation efforts in Madagascar. It evaluates the effectiveness of Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) as a method for ex-ante assessments.
Example: This research informs future academic work on ex-ante welfare assessment and influences how researchers in conservation and economics approach compensation schemes for displaced communities​(3).
Environmental Domain: The study provides critical insights into REDD+ programs (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and how they can affect local livelihoods through imposed forest use restrictions.
Example: By highlighting the potential local costs of conservation restrictions, this research directly informs policies on forest conservation and sustainable development​(3).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The research offers immediate insights into the local welfare costs of conservation projects. These findings can be used to inform compensation schemes and policy decisions for ongoing conservation projects in Madagascar and similar contexts globally.
Example: The findings on the inadequacies of existing compensation measures could lead to rapid adjustments in how REDD+ projects are implemented​(3).
Long-term Impact: Over time, the research could have a lasting impact on international conservation policies, shaping how compensation for local communities is structured in future environmental programs.
Example: The study’s critiques of REDD+ may lead to long-term changes in global conservation strategies, influencing how local socio-economic factors are integrated into policy decisions​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:
Local communities: Affected by conservation efforts and forest use restrictions.
Policymakers and international organizations: Engaged in designing and implementing REDD+ projects and other conservation initiatives.
Conservation NGOs: Involved in advocating for better compensation and community engagement.
Indirect Stakeholders:
Researchers: Studying environmental conservation, welfare impacts, and policy effectiveness.
Future generations: Benefiting from better-designed conservation programs that mitigate negative socio-economic impacts​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The study provides deep insights into the economic trade-offs involved in conservation policies, particularly for local communities affected by forest conservation. It emphasizes the need for valid compensation mechanisms that consider long-term household welfare.
Example: The use of DCEs in this context shows a deep exploration of how local populations perceive the trade-offs between cash compensation and access to forest resources​(3).
Breadth: The research’s influence spans multiple disciplines, including economics, environmental science, and public policy, addressing the global relevance of conservation efforts and their socio-economic ramifications​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The methods and findings from this study, particularly around welfare impact assessments, can be applied to other low-income countries and regions facing similar conservation challenges.
Example: The insights on compensation schemes can be scaled up to influence national or international policies on REDD+ projects in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The research approach, especially the use of DCEs, can be transferred to different sectors, such as infrastructure development or natural resource management, where local communities are similarly affected by development projects​(3)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study innovates by integrating qualitative debriefing with DCEs to better understand local preferences and decision-making processes, offering a more robust tool for estimating welfare costs before policy implementation.
Example: This novel combination of qualitative and quantitative data enhances the theoretical and content validity of the DCE method in low-income settings​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: The research disrupts traditional views of conservation as purely beneficial by highlighting the negative welfare impacts on local populations, questioning the sufficiency of existing compensation measures in REDD+ projects​(3)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The research emphasizes the need for sustainable conservation practices that do not undermine the socio-economic well-being of local communities. It questions the fairness of conservation restrictions that displace local livelihoods without adequate compensation.
Example: The study’s findings on the need for more equitable compensation mechanisms contribute to the broader goal of socially sustainable conservation policies​(3).
Ethical Considerations: The research raises important ethical issues about the balance between global environmental goals and local socio-economic costs, advocating for more fair and inclusive compensation systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Usability for Policymakers: The research offers actionable insights for policymakers on how to design fair compensation schemes for communities affected by conservation projects. It also provides a robust critique of the limitations of current methodologies used in ex-ante assessments.
Example: Policymakers can use these findings to create more effective and context-specific compensation frameworks for REDD+ projects​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: By combining approaches from economics, environmental science, and social policy, the research has broad relevance for both conservation professionals and development economists.
Example: The study’s findings could inform discussions in fields like sustainable development, rural economics, and environmental ethics, influencing interdisciplinary dialogues globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The insights on REDD+ and conservation practices are globally applicable, especially in countries facing challenges of deforestation and climate change mitigation​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study promotes the idea that conservation policies must be adaptable to the local socio-economic realities of affected populations. It encourages the development of resilient compensation mechanisms that evolve with changing economic and environmental conditions.
Example: The research highlights the need for adaptive management approaches in conservation, ensuring that policies remain relevant and effective over time​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This detailed analysis captures the full scope of potential impacts of the study, aligning with the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions, and emphasizes the study’s significant contributions to the fields of conservation, economic welfare, and policy development.
