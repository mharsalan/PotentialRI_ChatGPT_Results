Based on the content from the uploaded document and the text on research impact dimensions, here is the analysis for each of the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" based on the provided study:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The CUIDAR project influences several domains, including policy, education, social, and health sectors. It improves communication between children and policymakers involved in disaster management, engages various stakeholders, and introduces changes in how disaster management is approached, particularly by considering children's voices.
Page Reference and Section: Methods, Results, Discussion (pages 8-17)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research has direct impacts in educational settings by encouraging the inclusion of disaster education in schools and influencing local policy through child-centered disaster management frameworks.
Duration of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The research exhibits both short-term and long-term impacts. In the short-term, it brings immediate changes by enhancing communication strategies and disaster preparedness education. Long-term impacts include the establishment of child-inclusive disaster policies that are scalable and replicable across Europe.
Page Reference and Section: Results (pages 18-20) .
Example: The long-term impact involves changing public policy to integrate children’s perspectives into national disaster management frameworks.
Stakeholders of Research Impact:

Excerpts: Direct stakeholders include policymakers, educators, disaster risk managers, and children. Indirect stakeholders encompass the broader society that benefits from more inclusive and effective disaster management policies.
Page Reference and Section: Stakeholders section, Results (pages 18-20)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Policymakers benefit by receiving actionable insights from children, which helps develop more comprehensive disaster resilience strategies.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: The research deeply impacts disaster management by introducing child-centered frameworks, a novel approach that challenges traditional adult-centric models. It also has broad implications, affecting education, policy, social services, and emergency management sectors.
Page Reference and Section: Results and Discussion (pages 7-20)​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
Example: The research has broad impacts across multiple sectors, including disaster management, educational reforms, and community resilience efforts.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: The CUIDAR framework is designed to be scalable across different regions in Europe. The project's success in individual countries like Spain and Italy has led to potential national-level policy changes, showcasing its scalability. It is also transferable, with ideas being applied in different disaster contexts.
Page Reference and Section: Results, Implementation (pages 16-18)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The research can be scaled from local disaster management projects to national policies across Europe.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: This research disrupts traditional disaster management by placing children at the center of the discussion, which is typically dominated by adult experts. This shift encourages new ways of thinking about disaster resilience and risk communication.
Page Reference and Section: Results, Conclusion (pages 16-17)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: By involving children directly in disaster planning, the research has the potential to disrupt traditional approaches to emergency management and resilience-building.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts: The research emphasizes ethical considerations by advocating for children's rights in disaster management, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also promotes sustainable disaster preparedness strategies by ensuring that children are educated on risk and resilience.
Page Reference and Section: Discussion, Note on Ethics (pages 8-9) (Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: Ethical sustainability is ensured by embedding children's rights and perspectives into long-term disaster policies and planning.
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts: The research findings are highly implementable and have been used to inform disaster management practices. For example, the project's recommendations have led to the development of school emergency plans and changes in local government disaster responses.
Page Reference and Section: Results (pages 18-20)​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
Example: One practical example is the implementation of school emergency plans in response to the study's findings in Spain.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts: The research brings together various disciplines, including education, social policy, and disaster management. Its relevance transcends local or national contexts, as the framework can be adapted globally for child-centered disaster management.
Page Reference and Section: Results (pages 16-20)​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: The framework is applicable to other disaster-prone regions globally, demonstrating cross-disciplinary and international significance.
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts: The child-centered framework fosters resilience by engaging young people in disaster planning, which enhances their ability to adapt to future emergencies. It is flexible enough to be adapted to various types of disasters and geographical regions.
Page Reference and Section: Methods and Results (pages 7-9) .
Example: The framework can be adapted for different types of disasters, from forest fires to urban crises, ensuring resilience-building among children across contexts.
This analysis maps the findings of the CUIDAR study to each research impact dimension, demonstrating its wide-ranging and interdisciplinary influence.
