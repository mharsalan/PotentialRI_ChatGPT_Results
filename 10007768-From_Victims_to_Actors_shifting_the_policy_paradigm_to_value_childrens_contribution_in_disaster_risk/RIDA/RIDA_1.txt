Here is a detailed analysis of the research paper you provided, mapped to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact (RI). Each dimension is supported with excerpts from the paper and practical examples:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study emphasizes children's perspectives in flood management, arguing for their inclusion in policy, education, and emergency planning. It highlights that children are affected by flood risks and can contribute significantly to flood resilience strategies if given the chance to engage actively.

"Flood recovery and resilience must be seen as central to government in order to meet the needs of children and young people." (Results, page 437)
Example: This research impacts several domains:

Academic: Advances sociological theories around child citizenship and disaster response.
Policy: Influences flood resilience policies by advocating for children’s inclusion in emergency planning.
Education: Suggests changes in school curricula to include flood preparedness education.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research calls for both immediate changes in policy and long-term engagement with children in flood resilience efforts.

"Flood risk management will be more robust and demonstrate greater legitimacy by drawing on children and young people's perspectives." (Results, page 437)
Example:

Short-term Impact: This research can immediately influence school policies and local emergency preparedness, helping flood-affected areas incorporate children's voices.
Long-term Impact: It has the potential to change national flood management policies, influencing practices over decades by integrating child perspectives.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study identifies children, policymakers, educators, and local governments as key stakeholders in flood resilience management. Children’s perspectives are considered essential for effective flood response.

"All children and young people are citizens in their own right and have a role in flood risk management." (Results, page 437)
Example:

Direct Stakeholders: Local governments, schools, and emergency planning committees can use this research to shape more inclusive policies.
Indirect Stakeholders: The general public benefits from improved flood resilience and more inclusive community practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The research provides deep insights into how children's experiences can reshape flood resilience strategies. The breadth is seen in its cross-disciplinary approach involving education, policy, and community resilience.

"The children's sustained work for this project...demonstrates their determination to be seen as actors rather than passive victims." (Discussion, page 438)
Example:

Deep Impact: Transformative within flood risk management and child-centered disaster studies.
Broad Impact: It reaches across education, social policy, and disaster management disciplines, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The children’s manifestos suggest scalable changes to flood policies, making them adaptable across local, regional, and national levels.

"Flood policy and practice in England as currently organised, is confusing and over complex, reducing ability to address the recovery and resilience issues identified by children." (Discussion, page 437)
Example:

Scalability: Local-level recommendations for flood education can be scaled up to national curricula.
Transferability: The framework of involving children in disaster preparedness can be adapted globally, especially in other regions prone to floods.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The research challenges traditional flood governance by advocating for children's involvement in decision-making processes, disrupting the notion that disaster management is exclusively an adult domain.

"The Manifestos and the steps children took to advocate for them can be seen as acts of citizenship." (Discussion, page 438)
Example:

Innovation: Introduces a new perspective in flood risk management—children as active contributors.
Disruption: This approach disrupts conventional flood policy frameworks by integrating non-traditional stakeholders (children).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The study promotes ethical considerations by advocating for children’s rights in flood resilience and management, aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

"Children have the right to be heard and actively participate in decision-making that affects their lives." (Results, page 438)
Example:

Sustainability: Encourages long-term resilience-building in flood-affected communities through children's participation.
Ethical Considerations: Ensures fairness and justice in disaster response by recognizing children’s right to participate.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The paper suggests practical measures such as including children in disaster planning and integrating flood education in school curricula.

"Teachers need training about floods, and how they affect children and their education." (Results, page 436)
Example: The study is highly usable for policymakers and educators aiming to create child-centered disaster preparedness programs in schools and communities.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research is interdisciplinary, linking sociology, education, environmental science, and public policy to address complex flood management challenges.

"Floods are complex, heterogenous and have multiple effects; they can be heavily localised, yet relate to distal, global phenomena." (Results, page 440)
Example: Globally, regions facing frequent flooding can adopt the study’s recommendations, making it highly relevant across different geographic and socio-political contexts.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study strengthens community resilience by advocating for children’s involvement in flood risk management and recovery processes.

"Children’s participation and responses to this research shows that they can be powerful advocates for change in flood risk management." (Results, page 438)
Example: By involving children in disaster preparedness, this research builds adaptable strategies that can evolve as flood risks increase due to climate change.
