Based on the provided file and guidelines for assessing research impact across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact," here is an analysis for the study "Children, Young People and Flooding: Recovery and Resilience" by Mort et al.:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Children are known to be acutely affected during and after floods, losing their homes, friendship networks, and familiar surroundings... yet disaster and emergency plans still largely view children as victims... Recognizing children’s perspectives is a vital part of building community resilience." (Executive Summary, p.4-5)
Page Reference: Executive Summary, p. 4-5.
Example: This research impacts the social domain, as it addresses how children and young people contribute to flood recovery, challenging traditional perceptions of children as passive victims. It also affects the policy domain by advocating for incorporating children's voices into emergency and resilience planning.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The children recommended improvements in essentially three flood policy and practice domains - recovery, resilience, and education. A fundamental shift is required in the way policy is conceived." (Conclusions, p.26)
Page Reference: Conclusions, p.26.
Example: The study has long-term impact as it advocates for systemic changes in how children are treated in flood management and recovery, which could influence policies for years to come by integrating children's perspectives in resilience strategies.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpt: "Children’s and Young People’s Flood Manifestos have been pivotal in putting their ideas for change in front of stakeholders and government agencies." (Executive Summary, p.4)
Page Reference: Executive Summary, p.4.
Example: The primary stakeholders include policymakers, educational institutions, and local communities, as the research engages with these groups to reshape flood response strategies, making them more inclusive of children and youth.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "Flood policy and practice in England and Wales as currently organized is confusing and over-complex, reducing the ability to address the recovery and resilience issues identified by children." (Discussion, p.28)
Page Reference: Discussion, p.28.
Example: This research has broad impact across policy, educational, and social sectors, influencing how emergency management policies are structured and pushing for educational reforms that include disaster preparedness for children.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "Children’s experiences of the UK winter 2013/14 floods...developed ways of improving policy and practice to provide better support and enhance resilience." (Executive Summary, p.4)
Page Reference: Executive Summary, p.4.
Example: The methods and findings are scalable and transferable to other disaster contexts globally, encouraging the integration of children's perspectives in disaster management strategies beyond the UK.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "This report represents the first in-depth exploration of children’s experiences of flooding in the UK." (Executive Summary, p.4)
Page Reference: Executive Summary, p.4.
Example: The study is innovative as it disrupts traditional approaches to disaster management, advocating for children as active contributors, not just passive recipients of aid. This could reshape how resilience is understood across multiple sectors.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "Children’s capacities are a vital part of building community resilience... more effective policy can enhance resilience and reduce the impact of future emergencies." (Executive Summary, p.4)
Page Reference: Executive Summary, p.4.
Example: The research promotes sustainability by focusing on long-term resilience, ensuring that communities are better prepared for future disasters by including children's insights. Ethical considerations arise from ensuring that children’s voices are heard in policy.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The project outcomes include the development of a Flood Suitcase 'toolkit' to support flood-affected children." (p.25)
Page Reference: p.25.
Example: The study offers practical implementation tools, like the Flood Suitcase toolkit, which can be directly used by schools and communities to support children during flood recovery.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "The perspectives of children and young people are also missing from the vast majority of flood research studies." (p.7)
Page Reference: p.7.
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance, integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and disaster management, and is globally relevant, with potential applications in disaster response strategies worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "Flood-affected children have the experience to help them understand the measures that should be taken to prepare, protect, and adapt to flooding." (p.21)
Page Reference: p.21.
Example: The study fosters resilience by highlighting how children can adapt to flood experiences, promoting strategies that ensure communities are better prepared and resilient in the face of future disasters.
This analysis reflects the impact of the study across the dimensions, emphasizing its influence on policy, education, and social domains, with a focus on long-term change in disaster resilience strategies.
