Here is an assessment of the research impact dimensions for the study on "Children and Young People's Participation in Disaster Risk Reduction" (CUIDAR project), based on the file you've provided and the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" framework:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The CUIDAR project was designed to create a child-centred disaster risk management framework for Europe and beyond." (Preface, p. xv)
The research involved multiple sectors including education, policy, emergency management, and social sciences. Children and young people's participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) is framed as not only a social issue but also one related to emergency management practices.
Page Reference and Section: Preface, p. xv; Chapter 1, p. 1.

Example:

The research impacts the social domain by engaging children in disaster risk reduction and fostering community resilience. It also has significant influence in the educational domain as it develops new methods to educate children about disasters, and the policy domain by suggesting frameworks for integrating children's participation into national DRR strategies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"CUIDAR’s long-term goal is to shift disaster management cultures to be more inclusive of children’s voices, offering lasting changes in both policy and practice." (Preface, p. xvi)
Page Reference and Section: Preface, p. xvi; Results, p. 151.

Example:

Long-term Impact: The framework and methodologies developed are designed to be implemented over the long term in European DRR strategies. This has enduring implications for disaster management policy by embedding child participation within emergency planning frameworks.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Stakeholders involved included children, educators, policymakers, civil protection authorities, and NGOs such as Save the Children." (Introducing CUIDAR, p. xv)
Page Reference and Section: Preface, p. xv; Chapter 1, p. 3.

Example:

Direct Stakeholders: Educators, emergency planners, and policymakers directly use the findings and tools for child-inclusive disaster preparedness.
Indirect Stakeholders: The wider public benefits indirectly as community resilience improves through better disaster planning that includes diverse perspectives, including those of children.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"CUIDAR has influenced both theoretical frameworks around child-centered disaster risk reduction and practical tools used in schools and local governments." (Chapter 4, p. 93)
Page Reference and Section: Chapter 4, p. 93.

Example:

Deep Impact: It has significantly advanced the field of disaster risk reduction, offering new theoretical models for incorporating children’s participation.
Broad Impact: The project’s methodologies have been applied across various countries in Europe, and its concepts are transferable to different global contexts, especially in emergency management and child advocacy sectors.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"The framework is designed to be adaptable to various cultural and national contexts across Europe." (Preface, p. xvi)
Page Reference and Section: Preface, p. xvi; Methods, p. 93.

Example:

The framework has scalability within Europe, where different countries can implement it according to local needs. It is also transferable to other global regions, especially in developing child-centered disaster preparedness strategies.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"The project disrupts traditional disaster risk management by positioning children as active agents rather than passive victims." (Preface, p. xvi)
Page Reference and Section: Preface, p. xvi.

Example:

The innovation lies in challenging traditional disaster risk frameworks by empowering children as contributors to DRR. This represents a disruptive shift in how disaster preparedness and response are approached globally.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The ethical commitment to children's rights is central to CUIDAR, aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child." (Chapter 5, p. 118)
Page Reference and Section: Chapter 5, p. 118.

Example:

The framework emphasizes sustainability by advocating for long-term changes in how children are included in disaster planning. The ethical dimension ensures children's rights are respected and protected in disaster management policies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Participatory tools for engaging children in disaster risk management have been created, tested, and are now being used in schools and local government settings." (Chapter 5, p. 117)
Page Reference and Section: Chapter 5, p. 117.

Example:

The tools developed for child participation in DRR are highly usable, already being implemented in educational settings and local policy-making, demonstrating the research's practical applications.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The project integrates insights from sociology, education, emergency management, and child rights, creating a cross-disciplinary approach to disaster risk reduction." (Chapter 2, p. 39)
Page Reference and Section: Chapter 2, p. 39.

Example:

The cross-disciplinary nature of the research makes it globally relevant, especially in contexts where children’s rights intersect with public policy and emergency management.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Children’s participation in disaster risk management builds resilience at the community level by ensuring their needs and ideas are included in disaster planning." (Chapter 4, p. 105)
Page Reference and Section: Chapter 4, p. 105.

Example:

The project enhances community resilience by integrating children’s perspectives into disaster preparedness, making disaster risk reduction plans more adaptive to the needs of different communities and generations.
