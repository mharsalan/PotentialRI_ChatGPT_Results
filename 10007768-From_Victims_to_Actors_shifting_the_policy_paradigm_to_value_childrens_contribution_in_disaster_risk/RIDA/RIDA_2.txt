Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact for the study: "Mobilizing Children's Voices in UK Flood Risk Management" (2017)
Domains of Research Impact

Excerpts: The research focuses on flood risk management by capturing children's experiences during the 2013-2014 UK floods, emphasizing their sensory experiences and insights. It impacts multiple domains: environmental, educational, and policy-making, by integrating children's perspectives into flood risk management.
Page Reference: Abstract and Methods, p.76-93.
Example: By promoting children's voices in flood management strategies, this research has a direct impact on policy, ensuring that disaster preparedness and management include a wider range of stakeholders, including youth.
Duration of Research Impact

Excerpts: The study's long-term contribution lies in shaping how future flood risk management integrates community-based, child-inclusive practices. It informs ongoing policy development and disaster resilience strategies.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 90-93.
Example: The participatory approach used in the study is foundational for future disaster response research, potentially informing policies over decades as communities become more climate-resilient.
Stakeholder of Research Impact

Excerpts: Stakeholders include children, communities, policymakers, and emergency management professionals. The research emphasizes the importance of involving children directly in decision-making processes around disaster management.
Page Reference: Methods, p. 80-85.
Example: Policymakers are directly impacted by the study’s findings, which advocate for child-inclusive strategies in flood risk management, while the broader public indirectly benefits from more effective and inclusive disaster preparedness.
Depth and Breadth of Impact

Excerpts: The research has deep impacts in the fields of disaster management and sociology by providing a model for integrating children's voices into emergency response. It also has broad impacts across educational, environmental, and social policy domains.
Page Reference: Results and Discussion, p. 88-93.
Example: The study’s methodology can be applied broadly to other forms of disaster management and public health crises, influencing interdisciplinary fields such as environmental sociology, education, and child psychology.
Scalability and Transferability

Excerpts: The participatory, child-centered approach in the research is scalable to different regions and can be adapted to various environmental and disaster contexts.
Page Reference: Methods and Results, p. 82-88.
Example: The methods used in the UK floods can be transferred to other disaster-prone areas globally, particularly in regions affected by climate change, ensuring child-inclusive disaster risk reduction strategies.
Innovation and Disruption Potential

Excerpts: The innovative aspect of the study lies in its action-based methodology that positions children as "flood actors." This challenges traditional top-down models of disaster management by integrating younger community members as active participants.
Page Reference: Abstract and Methods, p. 76-80.
Example: By redefining the role of children in disaster management, the research disrupts conventional approaches, potentially influencing future emergency response frameworks.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations

Excerpts: Ethical considerations are central to this research, focusing on inclusivity, empowerment, and the sustainable engagement of vulnerable groups such as children in disaster management.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 91-93.
Example: The research promotes long-term sustainability in flood management by ensuring that future strategies are socially inclusive and ethically sound, addressing the needs of marginalized populations like children.
Implementation and Usability

Excerpts: The study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, with easy-to-implement strategies for including children's voices in local and national flood risk management.
Page Reference: Discussion and Conclusion, p. 92-93.
Example: The research offers a framework that can be directly applied by local councils and disaster relief agencies to improve flood preparedness through child-inclusive approaches.
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance

Excerpts: The research is cross-disciplinary, incorporating sociology, environmental studies, education, and public policy. It also addresses a global issue—climate-induced flooding—making its findings relevant internationally.
Page Reference: Abstract and Results, p. 80-93.
Example: The research could inform global flood risk management practices, particularly in regions increasingly affected by climate change, ensuring that disaster management strategies are inclusive and effective across diverse cultural contexts.
Resilience and Adaptability

Excerpts: The study's methodology and findings are adaptable to different environmental disasters beyond floods and can evolve with changing climatic conditions and community needs.
Page Reference: Discussion, p. 89-93.
Example: The adaptable nature of the research ensures that as climate risks evolve, disaster management strategies will continue to integrate diverse community perspectives, maintaining the relevance of this approach over time.
Each of these dimensions highlights the research’s potential to influence various sectors, extend over time, and be applied in diverse contexts, ensuring a significant and lasting impact on flood risk management and beyond.
