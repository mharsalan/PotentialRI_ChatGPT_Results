Based on the study and the principles from the research impact frameworks, here are the potential research impacts organized by types of impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Social Impact: The study significantly contributes to societal change by promoting child-inclusive disaster management policies. This has the potential to shift how disaster risk reduction strategies are planned and implemented at both local and national levels​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Educational Impact: The project impacts education by promoting disaster awareness in school curricula and engaging children in disaster preparedness, enhancing their resilience and understanding of risks​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Policy Impact: The research influences public policy by advocating for the inclusion of children’s voices in disaster management frameworks, contributing to the development of child-centered disaster risk reduction strategies at various levels of governance​(impact pathway).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The study has immediate effects by creating child-inclusive frameworks for local disaster preparedness initiatives. For example, engaging schools and local governments in creating emergency plans tailored to children​(impact pathway).
Long-term Impact: In the long term, the study’s frameworks could influence national and international disaster management policies. By integrating children’s perspectives into policy frameworks, it ensures more resilient and inclusive disaster preparedness for future generations​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Policymakers, disaster management professionals, educators, and community leaders are direct beneficiaries of the study. They receive practical frameworks for integrating children’s views into disaster preparedness​(impact pathway).
Indirect Stakeholders: Children, families, and communities indirectly benefit from more inclusive, resilient disaster risk strategies. The public also benefits from enhanced disaster management policies that reduce risks and improve recovery efforts​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The child-centered disaster management framework developed in the study can be scaled from local applications to national and international disaster risk reduction strategies. It is already being adapted across various European regions​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Transferability: The framework is applicable to a variety of disaster scenarios (e.g., earthquakes, floods, pandemics) and can be transferred to different cultural, geographical, and institutional contexts globally​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces a new way of thinking about disaster preparedness by focusing on children’s perspectives, which were traditionally overlooked. This shifts disaster management from a top-down approach to a more inclusive, bottom-up strategy​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Disruption: By disrupting traditional adult-centric disaster management models, the study challenges established practices and promotes the inclusion of often marginalized voices (children) in important decision-making processes​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The study promotes sustainable disaster risk management by ensuring that the voices of future generations (children) are included. This contributes to long-term resilience and sustainability in disaster preparedness​(impact pathway).
Ethical Considerations: Ethically, the study aligns with the principles of children’s rights and participation, ensuring that vulnerable populations are involved in decisions that directly affect them​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Implementation and Usability
Practical Implementation: The study provides actionable frameworks and tools for implementing child-centered disaster preparedness strategies in schools and local governments. These can be easily adopted by policymakers and educators​(Research impact toolkit).
Usability: The frameworks are designed to be user-friendly for practitioners in disaster management, ensuring that the findings can be easily applied in real-world contexts​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study intersects with fields such as education, psychology, social policy, and disaster management. This cross-disciplinary relevance makes it adaptable to different sectors aiming to improve disaster resilience​(Research impact toolkit).
Global Relevance: The research has global implications, especially for regions frequently impacted by natural disasters, as it can be applied in diverse geographic and socio-political contexts​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The study enhances community resilience by empowering children to understand and respond to disaster risks. This fosters a more resilient society prepared for future disasters​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
Adaptability: The child-centered framework is adaptable to various types of disasters, including both natural and human-induced crises, making it a flexible tool for diverse emergency contexts​(impact pathway).
10. Equity and Inclusivity
Promoting Inclusion: By focusing on children’s participation, the study promotes equity and inclusivity, ensuring that all members of society, regardless of age, are involved in disaster preparedness efforts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Reducing Marginalization: The research helps reduce the marginalization of children in policymaking and disaster management, which traditionally overlooked their needs and perspectives​(Research impact toolkit).
11. Public Awareness and Behavioral Change
Raising Awareness: The study raises public awareness about the importance of including children in disaster preparedness and resilience-building efforts. It encourages communities to involve younger generations in safety planning​(Research impact toolkit).
Behavioral Change: Through education and engagement, the study encourages behavioral changes in how communities prepare for and respond to disasters, particularly in involving children in these processes​(impact pathway).
12. Capacity Building and Training
Capacity Building: The study builds capacity by training educators, policymakers, and disaster management professionals to work with children in disaster risk reduction efforts, enhancing the overall resilience of communities​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
13. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Policy Influence: The research directly influences policies related to disaster management by advocating for child-inclusive strategies and frameworks that can be adopted at both local and national levels​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Research impact toolkit).
Advocacy for Children’s Rights: The study aligns with advocacy for children’s rights, particularly in ensuring their inclusion in decisions that affect their safety and well-being​(Research impact toolkit).
