Based on a thorough reading of the attached study and using the frameworks and dimensions provided from the research impact documents, here is a detailed breakdown of the potential research impacts specific to the study. I have categorized these according to different types of impacts:

1. Educational and Capacity Building Impact
Teacher Training and Skills Development: The study involves training teachers in participatory theater methods. This builds their capacity to engage children in creative processes that enhance community resilience. The training offers a long-term educational impact by introducing new methodologies that can be integrated into school curriculums​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Student Development and Empowerment: The use of participatory theater empowers children by allowing them to express their opinions on community resilience, thus fostering creativity and critical thinking. This approach not only impacts students directly but also shapes future educational practices by highlighting the value of student voices in disaster recovery scenarios​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Societal and Community Impact
Community Resilience: The study’s participatory approach to disaster preparedness in Fukushima encourages children to actively participate in community rebuilding processes. This has significant societal impact, particularly in post-disaster areas, by fostering resilience at the community level through engagement with younger generations​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Cultural and Social Change: By involving children in community-based theater projects, the study contributes to cultural preservation and the promotion of social cohesion. It also challenges traditional adult-centric models of disaster management, introducing a more inclusive and community-focused approach​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovative Educational Practices: The study’s integration of participatory theater within the educational framework disrupts traditional disaster education models. This innovative practice not only engages children but also alters the pedagogical approaches used by teachers, promoting creative methods for community engagement​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Disruption in Disaster Management: The study introduces a novel approach to disaster management by emphasizing the role of children as active participants in community resilience. This challenges conventional disaster management frameworks, which often overlook the potential contributions of younger generations​(impact pathway).
4. Health and Well-being Impact
Mental Health and Emotional Resilience: Engaging children in creative processes such as participatory theater has the potential to improve their emotional well-being, especially in post-disaster settings. By giving children a platform to express their fears, hopes, and ideas, the study contributes to their mental health and helps them cope with trauma​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Improved Community Health: The focus on resilience building through education also has broader health impacts by contributing to the emotional and psychological recovery of entire communities, which can lead to improved long-term public health outcomes​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Educational Policy: The success of integrating participatory theater in disaster resilience education can inform educational policies, particularly in disaster-prone regions. This study could encourage the development of curricula that focus on community-based, creative disaster preparedness strategies​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Advocacy for Child Participation in Policy: The study advocates for the inclusion of children’s voices in community decision-making processes, which can influence broader policy discussions on child rights and participatory governance​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainable Community Practices: By fostering a sense of responsibility and involvement in disaster management among children, the study promotes sustainable practices that can be passed down to future generations. This contributes to long-term environmental resilience, particularly in disaster recovery​(Research impact toolkit).
Disaster Preparedness and Environmental Awareness: The study also indirectly raises awareness about environmental risks associated with natural disasters, encouraging both students and communities to adopt more sustainable, disaster-resilient practices​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Behavioral and Social Change
Behavioral Change in Education and Disaster Preparedness: The research encourages changes in how disaster preparedness is taught and understood in schools, focusing more on active participation, creativity, and local context. This leads to a broader societal shift in how communities prepare for and recover from disasters​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Empowerment of Marginalized Groups: Children, who are often marginalized in disaster recovery, are given a voice and an active role through this study. This empowerment leads to behavioral changes in communities, recognizing the capabilities and contributions of younger generations in recovery efforts​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Application of Educational Models: The participatory theater model developed in this study has the potential for transferability to other global contexts, particularly in disaster-prone regions. Its cross-disciplinary approach, blending arts, education, and disaster management, makes it applicable in a variety of cultural and social settings​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
International Collaboration in Disaster Management: The study’s innovative approach can be adapted and shared across international boundaries, promoting global collaboration in educational strategies for disaster preparedness​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Technological and Methodological Innovation
Innovative Research Methodologies: The use of text-mining and participatory theater as research tools is a methodological innovation. These approaches provide new ways to gather data on children’s perspectives and contribute to the broader academic understanding of community resilience​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Knowledge Dissemination and Public Awareness
Raising Public Awareness: The study’s findings can be disseminated widely to raise awareness of the importance of involving children in disaster recovery. Public awareness campaigns based on this research could emphasize the role of education in building resilient communities​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Contributions to Academic Knowledge: The study contributes to the academic literature on disaster resilience, particularly in terms of innovative educational practices and the role of creative arts in community recovery​(Research Impact Knowled…).
In summary, this study has significant potential to generate a broad range of research impacts, spanning from educational innovations and community resilience to mental health improvements and policy influence. Its cross-disciplinary approach makes it a valuable resource for disaster-prone regions globally, particularly those looking to engage younger generations in sustainable recovery practices.
