Based on the comprehensive reading of the provided study "Mobilizing Children's Voices in UK Flood Risk Management," I have identified several potential research impacts aligned with various types of impact dimensions. Here is a detailed classification:

1. Social Impact
Stakeholder Engagement: The study deeply involves children as key stakeholders in flood risk management, a group traditionally overlooked in this domain. Engaging children provides new perspectives that can enhance disaster resilience in affected communities.
Impact: The social impact is profound in improving how communities and policymakers recognize the value of diverse voices, including children, in managing natural disasters like floods​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Community Empowerment: Through participatory action research, the study empowers local communities by incorporating children’s firsthand experiences and contributions to disaster risk management strategies.
Impact: This creates a ripple effect in the community, where enhanced resilience, inclusivity, and empowerment are promoted​(Research Impact Knowled…).
2. Policy Impact
Influence on Flood Risk Management Policies: The study offers insights that are directly relevant to shaping local and national flood management policies. By presenting evidence that children’s input can meaningfully improve disaster preparedness and response, it influences policymakers to include diverse demographic perspectives in future policies​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Impact: The study could lead to policy adjustments, particularly in the inclusion of children in national disaster risk strategies and frameworks.
3. Educational Impact
Child-Centered Learning Approaches: By recognizing children's cognitive and emotional capacities in flood scenarios, the study proposes new educational frameworks for disaster preparedness that can be implemented in school curricula.
Impact: Educators could adopt this model to teach disaster resilience, leading to better-informed future generations who are prepared for climate change-related disasters​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Environmental Impact
Enhanced Environmental Awareness: The study underscores the importance of children’s perspectives in understanding and reacting to environmental changes, particularly climate-induced floods.
Impact: Encouraging young generations to engage with environmental issues can lead to broader societal commitment to sustainability and climate action​(Common Research Impact …).
5. Behavioral Change and Safety Improvement
Change in Disaster Response Practices: By presenting children as active participants in disaster response, the study influences behavioral changes in disaster preparedness strategies within households and communities.
Impact: Improved safety practices are likely to arise from integrating children’s experiences and ideas into community-level disaster preparedness plans​(impact pathway).
6. Innovation and Disruption in Traditional Research Methods
Innovative Participatory Research: The methodology employed in the study—engaging children directly—disrupts conventional research and disaster response frameworks. It introduces a new participatory model that views children as “flood actors,” challenging traditional top-down approaches to disaster management​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Impact: This innovative approach may inspire other researchers to adopt participatory methods in various fields beyond disaster management, contributing to broader academic advancements.
7. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Applicability of Research: Though focused on the UK, the findings from this study are transferable to other global contexts where flood risk management is relevant, especially in regions increasingly impacted by climate change.
Impact: The methods and outcomes are likely to influence flood management strategies internationally, especially in developing nations or regions prone to natural disasters​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Capacity Building and Training
Training for Future Flood Management Professionals: The study’s outcomes could contribute to training modules for disaster management professionals, teaching them how to integrate diverse and vulnerable population perspectives into disaster preparedness.
Impact: This builds capacity among practitioners and policymakers for more inclusive disaster management systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Public Awareness and Knowledge Dissemination
Raising Awareness of Vulnerable Populations in Disasters: The research helps to bring awareness to the experiences and needs of children during environmental disasters, which could lead to broader discussions in public forums and media.
Impact: Increased public awareness can foster better community preparedness and support for vulnerable groups during crises​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Long-Term Societal Impact
Resilience and Adaptability in Communities: By shaping disaster preparedness strategies that include children, the study enhances the overall resilience and adaptability of communities to future floods and other climate-related challenges.
Impact: Over time, this resilience contributes to better societal outcomes, reducing the long-term effects of natural disasters​(Common Research Impact …).
11. Equity and Inclusivity
Promoting Equity in Disaster Management: The study emphasizes the importance of including marginalized voices (children) in disaster management planning, which promotes a more equitable approach to disaster response and preparation.
Impact: It can potentially lead to more inclusive policy-making and disaster response frameworks, addressing systemic disparities in who is consulted and protected during crises​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
12. Health and Well-being
Psychological Well-being of Children: By ensuring that children’s voices are heard in disaster management, the study indirectly promotes their psychological well-being, as feeling involved and valued can reduce trauma and anxiety during disasters.
Impact: This research contributes to better mental health outcomes for children in disaster-prone areas​(impact pathway).
13. Technological Adoption
Utilization of Technology for Child-Centered Disaster Preparedness: The study opens the door to using technology (such as child-friendly apps or digital platforms) to involve children in disaster preparedness.
Impact: This encourages the adoption of innovative technologies designed to improve the engagement of younger populations in disaster preparedness​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts demonstrate how this research significantly contributes to multiple fields, influencing social, policy, environmental, educational, and behavioral practices, both in the UK and potentially globally.
