Based on the CUIDAR study and the research impact dimensions provided in the documents, here are the potential research impacts, organized by types of impact:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge: The study advances understanding of child-centered disaster risk reduction (DRR). It develops new theories and methodologies for including children in DRR planning, which can inform further research in sociology, education, disaster management, and policy studies​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cross-disciplinary Research: This study integrates insights from education, sociology, psychology, and emergency management, enriching all of these fields. The interdisciplinary nature of the research could lead to new areas of academic inquiry​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
2. Policy Impact
Influencing Policy: The study provides evidence and frameworks to inform national and international policies on disaster risk management, particularly in integrating children’s voices into disaster preparedness and response strategies. This can influence local and national government policies in Europe and beyond​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Ethical and Legal Considerations: By advocating for children’s rights in disaster management, the study contributes to policy changes that align with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, potentially influencing future legislation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Social Impact
Behavioral Change: The study’s focus on involving children in DRR efforts could lead to shifts in how communities engage with children during disaster preparedness, ultimately changing societal behaviors around community resilience​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Community Engagement: By actively involving children in participatory research, the study enhances community resilience and encourages local empowerment, making communities more prepared for disasters​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development: The study could impact educational institutions by providing new approaches and curricula focused on disaster preparedness for young people. Teachers and educators may adopt these methods in both formal and informal educational settings​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Capacity Building: The research fosters capacity building for children, educators, and emergency planners by equipping them with the skills and knowledge to effectively engage in disaster preparedness​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Mental Health and Well-being: By including children in discussions around disaster management, the research can improve their psychological resilience and mental health during and after disasters, potentially reducing trauma and anxiety​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Public Health: The study's frameworks could influence public health strategies, particularly in protecting vulnerable populations like children during health emergencies and natural disasters​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainability and Resilience: The study promotes sustainable and resilient practices in disaster management by ensuring that future generations (children) are prepared to deal with environmental challenges. This contributes to long-term environmental sustainability in disaster management practices​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Technological and Methodological Impact
Innovative Methods for Disaster Preparedness: The participatory tools and methods developed for involving children in disaster risk reduction represent technological innovation. These tools can be adapted for use in various sectors and countries, making the research highly scalable​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Implementation and Usability: The study has practical tools for immediate application in educational and policy settings, such as the participatory frameworks used to engage children in disaster management​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Cultural and Artistic Impact
Cultural Shifts: By advocating for the inclusion of children in DRR, the study could shift cultural norms regarding the role of children in disaster management, encouraging societies to value children’s input in broader public decision-making processes​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Economic Impact
Return on Investment: By reducing the long-term costs of disaster recovery through more effective planning that includes children’s insights, the research can lead to significant economic benefits for governments and communities​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Equity and Inclusivity
Inclusivity in Disaster Preparedness: The study promotes inclusivity by integrating children’s perspectives into disaster risk management, addressing an often overlooked group in traditional DRR strategies. This contributes to more equitable disaster preparedness systems​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
11. International Collaboration and Diplomacy
Global Relevance: The study’s frameworks can be applied globally, especially in regions prone to natural disasters. It fosters international collaboration among countries to improve disaster risk management for children and communities​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Public Awareness and Communication
Public Engagement: By increasing public awareness about the role children can play in disaster risk management, the study can drive greater community involvement and improve communication between children, families, and emergency planners​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
These impacts align with several key dimensions of research impact, and demonstrate how the CUIDAR project is poised to influence a wide array of societal, academic, policy, and community-driven outcomes across multiple sectors.
