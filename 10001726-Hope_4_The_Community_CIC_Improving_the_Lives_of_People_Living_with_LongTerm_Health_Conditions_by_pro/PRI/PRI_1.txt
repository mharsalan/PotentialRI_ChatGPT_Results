Based on my understanding of the study titled "A Co-Produced Self-Management Programme Improves Psychosocial Outcomes for People Living with Depression" and aligning it with predefined research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of this study, categorized into as many relevant dimensions as possible:

1. Health and Well-Being Impact
Description: The study significantly improves patient activation, reduces depression and anxiety, and enhances overall quality of life for individuals living with depression.
Example: The findings suggest that a co-produced self-management program (SMP) for depression could directly contribute to better mental health outcomes and improve psychosocial well-being in participants​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Impact: This study contributes to the growing literature on co-production and patient activation, especially in the mental health domain.
Social Impact: It promotes the involvement of patients as active participants in their own health management, challenging traditional models of clinician-led mental health care​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Description: The study has the potential to influence mental health policy by providing an evidence-based, low-cost intervention that can be integrated into existing healthcare services, such as the NHS in the UK.
Example: By demonstrating the efficacy of patient-centered self-management, this research can inform healthcare policies that prioritize patient empowerment and reduce service demand​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
4. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
Description: The co-produced SMP is low-cost and scalable, offering economic benefits by potentially reducing healthcare costs associated with long-term mental health care.
Example: This program may lead to fewer hospital visits and less reliance on clinical interventions, thereby reducing the overall costs to the healthcare system​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The program’s structure, involving co-production and peer-support models, can be scaled to a wider population or transferred to other health conditions such as chronic diseases.
Transferability: The co-production model used in mental health can be applied to other areas of healthcare, such as diabetes management or long-term conditions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Social and Cultural Impact
Description: The co-production approach blurs traditional distinctions between professionals and patients, empowering individuals and fostering greater community participation in mental health management.
Example: This study fosters social change by shifting the role of patients from passive recipients to active co-producers of healthcare, potentially influencing societal views on patient autonomy​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The study introduces an innovative model of healthcare delivery by integrating co-production and peer support into mental health services.
Example: This approach challenges traditional healthcare delivery models, disrupting the typical clinician-led structure by making patients co-designers of their care​(1)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The program promotes long-term sustainability by encouraging patients to develop self-management skills, which reduces their dependency on healthcare services.
Ethical Considerations: By valuing patients’ lived experiences, the program aligns with ethical principles of autonomy, respect, and shared decision-making​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Description: The findings of this study are relevant to both mental health professionals and policymakers, and can influence global healthcare practices, especially in regions exploring low-cost, scalable mental health interventions.
Example: As mental health issues are global, the co-produced SMP model could be adapted and implemented in various countries, making it relevant in both local and international healthcare contexts​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Description: The program is adaptable across different healthcare settings and patient populations, making it resilient to changes in healthcare demands or resource constraints.
Example: The flexibility of the co-produced model allows it to be implemented in both community and institutional healthcare settings, ensuring its relevance in diverse contexts​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
11. Implementation and Usability
Description: The program’s ease of implementation within existing healthcare pathways, such as the NHS, makes it highly usable in real-world settings.
Example: With a structure that encourages participation from both professionals and patients, the study's findings can be readily applied to improve mental health services at scale​(1)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
12. Public Awareness and Education
Description: The research increases awareness of the benefits of patient-led mental health care and promotes educational outreach on the importance of self-management in chronic conditions.
Example: By involving patients directly in their care, the program encourages a wider public understanding of co-production models, potentially influencing future mental health education and outreach programs​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
13. Capacity Building and Training
Description: The program provides a framework for training both healthcare providers and patients in co-production techniques, enhancing overall capacity in the healthcare system.
Example: Through peer support and professional collaboration, the study promotes the development of new skills among healthcare workers and patients alike​(Research impact toolkit).
These dimensions highlight the multifaceted research impact of this study, showing how it affects mental health outcomes, healthcare delivery, policy, and social practices on both a national and potentially global scale.
