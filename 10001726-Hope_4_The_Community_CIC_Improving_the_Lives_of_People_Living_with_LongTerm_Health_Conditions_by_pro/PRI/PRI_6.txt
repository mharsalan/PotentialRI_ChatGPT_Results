Based on the study titled "Self-Management Support Intervention for Parents of Children with Developmental Disorders: The Role of Gratitude and Hope", the potential research impacts of this study can be framed according to several Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Health and Well-Being Impact
Description: The study directly contributes to the improvement of mental health and well-being of parents of children with developmental disorders (DD). By integrating gratitude and hope as psychological tools, the intervention aims to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety in this population.
Example: The research demonstrated that participants experienced significant reductions in depression and anxiety levels post-intervention, highlighting how this peer-delivered self-management program has a tangible impact on mental health​(6)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Description: The intervention addresses social isolation and the emotional toll faced by parents caring for children with DD. By fostering peer support and creating a community-based model, the study has social benefits, reducing stigmatization and promoting social cohesion.
Example: Parents reported feeling less isolated and more connected to others facing similar challenges, creating a supportive social network that could be sustained beyond the intervention​(6).
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Description: This study can inform healthcare and social care policies aimed at supporting families dealing with developmental disorders. By providing evidence of the effectiveness of peer-led interventions, the research could influence policies on mental health care and support services for caregivers.
Example: Findings from the study can be used to advocate for the inclusion of self-management and peer-support programs in public health policies, particularly those related to mental health and caregiving​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
4. Economic Impact
Description: The peer-delivered nature of the intervention presents a cost-effective solution for mental health support. By using peer facilitators rather than professional therapists, the intervention reduces the need for resource-intensive mental health services.
Example: The scalability of the intervention allows it to be implemented at a lower cost in various settings, making it economically viable for large-scale application​(6).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The intervention is scalable, as it relies on peer facilitators who can be trained to deliver the program in diverse settings. The principles of the program (self-management, gratitude, and hope) are also transferable to other populations facing similar mental health challenges, such as caregivers of individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities.
Example: The model could be adapted to support other groups, including caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, or other long-term conditions​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The study introduces an innovative approach to caregiver support by incorporating positive psychology (hope and gratitude) into a self-management framework. This disrupts the traditional deficit-based models of mental health interventions by focusing on enhancing positive emotions rather than solely reducing negative ones.
Example: This focus on positive psychology is relatively novel in the field of caregiver support, setting a new direction for future interventions targeting mental health resilience through gratitude and hope​(6)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
7. Knowledge Accumulation and Scientific Progress
Description: The study adds to the body of scientific knowledge on self-management interventions for caregivers, specifically in the context of developmental disorders. It contributes to the growing field of positive psychology and its applications in mental health interventions.
Example: The research provides a foundation for further studies on how gratitude and hope can be systematically integrated into support programs for caregivers, thus advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application​(6)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Public Awareness and Education
Description: The study raises awareness about the mental health needs of parents with children suffering from developmental disorders, highlighting the importance of addressing caregiver well-being. The positive results can be shared with the public to promote mental health strategies and peer support.
Example: Findings from the study can be used to develop public health campaigns or workshops aimed at educating caregivers about the benefits of peer support and self-management​(6).
9. Capacity Building and Training
Description: By training peer facilitators, the study builds capacity within communities, empowering individuals to lead support programs. This contributes to the sustainability of the intervention, as facilitators can continue to deliver the program after the study concludes.
Example: The training model developed in the study could be replicated in different communities, increasing the number of trained facilitators and expanding the reach of the intervention​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
Description: The research offers a low-cost, scalable mental health intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice, particularly in mental health care for caregivers. Healthcare providers can adopt this intervention to complement existing services for parents of children with developmental disorders.
Example: Clinics that serve children with developmental disorders could integrate the HOPE program into their family support services, improving overall caregiver outcomes while reducing demand on traditional mental health services​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
These potential impacts demonstrate the broad influence this study could have on health, social support systems, policy development, and mental health care practices.
