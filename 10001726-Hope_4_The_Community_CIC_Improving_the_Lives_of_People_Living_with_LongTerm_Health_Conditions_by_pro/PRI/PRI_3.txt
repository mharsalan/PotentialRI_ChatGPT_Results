Based on the study titled "Help to Overcome Problems Effectively for Cancer Survivors: Development and Evaluation of a Digital Self-Management Program" and aligning it with the predefined research impact dimensions, here are the potential research impacts of this study in as much detail as possible:

1. Health and Well-Being Impact
Description: The iHOPE (Help to Overcome Problems Effectively) digital self-management program directly contributes to improvements in the mental and physical well-being of cancer survivors. The program's focus on reducing psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and fear of recurrence) and increasing positive emotions (hope, gratitude, and overall mental well-being) demonstrates its strong impact on health outcomes.
Example: Participants in the program showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and cancer-related fatigue, while also reporting increases in mental well-being, hope, and gratitude​(3)​(Common Research Impact …). These outcomes have immediate health benefits and longer-term implications for improved quality of life among cancer survivors.
2. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Description: This study has the potential to influence health policies by demonstrating the effectiveness of digital self-management programs in supporting cancer survivors. The findings provide strong evidence for the inclusion of self-management interventions in national cancer care strategies, such as those promoted by the UK National Health Service (NHS).
Example: The research supports ongoing policy efforts to integrate digital tools into healthcare systems, specifically targeting the needs of cancer survivors post-treatment. This aligns with broader healthcare policies focused on long-term condition management​(3)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Clinical Practice and Healthcare Improvement
Description: The iHOPE program introduces a practical and scalable approach to cancer survivorship care, complementing traditional clinical treatments with peer-supported digital interventions. This can lead to changes in clinical practice, where self-management becomes an integral part of long-term care strategies for cancer patients.
Example: By incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology into a digital format, the program provides healthcare professionals with a new tool for addressing the psychosocial needs of cancer survivors, potentially reducing the reliance on in-person consultations​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
4. Economic Impact and Return on Investment
Description: The study's digital self-management program could lead to economic benefits by reducing the demand for intensive in-person healthcare services, such as therapy or counseling sessions, as patients become more self-sufficient in managing their post-cancer mental health. Additionally, the scalability of digital platforms can significantly lower costs compared to traditional healthcare delivery.
Example: The iHOPE program's scalability makes it cost-effective, allowing more cancer survivors to access support without increasing healthcare system costs​(3)​(Research impact toolkit).
5. Social and Cultural Impact
Description: The program has a positive social impact by fostering a sense of community and peer support among cancer survivors. This helps reduce the social isolation commonly experienced by survivors post-treatment, while also promoting a culture of self-reliance and empowerment.
Example: The peer-led aspect of the program, where cancer survivors facilitate the sessions, encourages participants to connect with others who share similar experiences, reducing feelings of isolation and creating a supportive community environment​(3)​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Scalability and Transferability
Description: The digital nature of the iHOPE program ensures that it can be scaled to reach a wider population of cancer survivors, both nationally and internationally. Moreover, the self-management principles used in the program can be adapted to other chronic diseases, making it transferable across different healthcare settings.
Example: The program’s use of technology enables it to reach survivors in remote or underserved areas, ensuring equitable access to support. Additionally, the self-management framework could be adapted to support individuals with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Description: The iHOPE program is innovative in its approach to cancer care, combining positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy in a digital format that is peer-facilitated. This disrupts traditional models of post-cancer care, which often rely heavily on healthcare professionals.
Example: By allowing cancer survivors to take control of their mental health through self-management and peer support, the program challenges the clinician-led model and empowers patients to be more involved in their recovery process​(3)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Description: The iHOPE program promotes sustainability by using digital platforms to deliver care, which reduces the environmental and financial costs associated with in-person healthcare services. Ethically, the program respects patient autonomy by empowering survivors to manage their health, while offering equitable access to mental health support.
Example: The program's digital format ensures that it can be sustained with minimal resources, while the emphasis on peer support and self-management aligns with ethical healthcare practices that prioritize patient empowerment​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
9. Knowledge Dissemination and Communication
Description: The study's findings have the potential to be widely disseminated across academic, clinical, and public health communities. The publication of results in open-access journals and presentations at cancer survivorship conferences ensure that the research reaches a broad audience, facilitating knowledge sharing.
Example: Researchers can use the study's findings to engage with healthcare providers and policymakers, ensuring that the benefits of digital self-management programs are understood and adopted more widely​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Capacity Building and Training
Description: The program builds capacity within healthcare systems by training cancer survivors to become peer facilitators, thus creating a sustainable model for delivering psychosocial support. It also provides healthcare professionals with a new tool to complement traditional clinical interventions.
Example: The peer-led aspect of the iHOPE program allows cancer survivors to develop leadership and facilitation skills, contributing to the broader goal of capacity building within cancer care and beyond​(3)​(Research impact toolkit).
