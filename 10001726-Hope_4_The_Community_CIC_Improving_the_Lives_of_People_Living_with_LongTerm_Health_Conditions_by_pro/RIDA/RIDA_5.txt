Based on the text of the study titled "Development and feasibility of the Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (HOPE) self-management intervention for people living with multiple sclerosis" and aligned with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, here is a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Health Domain: The HOPE: MS intervention primarily impacts the health domain by targeting both the physical and psychological well-being of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). The self-management intervention uses a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and positive psychology to improve outcomes such as fatigue, depression, self-efficacy, and overall quality of life for MS patients​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Educational Domain: The intervention also contributes to the educational domain by providing participants with self-management skills, including goal setting, action planning, and techniques to cope with fatigue, stress, and depression. Participants are trained to take more control over their health, which indirectly enhances their ability to learn and apply health-related knowledge​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: In the short term, the study has shown immediate improvements in MS-related outcomes, including reductions in fatigue, depression, and psychological impact, as well as increases in self-efficacy and positive affect​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Long-term Impact: Long-term impacts could involve the lasting improvements in self-management skills among MS patients, potentially reducing their reliance on healthcare services over time. The HOPE: MS program also has the potential to serve as a foundational model for other self-management interventions for chronic conditions​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: The primary beneficiaries are MS patients who gain self-management skills that can improve their daily lives. Healthcare providers and organizations, such as the MS Society, are also direct stakeholders since they may adopt the program as part of their care models​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders: Family members and caregivers of MS patients could benefit indirectly from the intervention by observing improvements in the patient's ability to manage symptoms and stress​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study has a deep impact within the field of MS care by focusing on the mental and physical well-being of patients. It addresses critical issues such as depression and fatigue, which are common among MS patients, and has the potential to change how self-management interventions are developed for neurological conditions​(5).
Broad Impact: The principles of positive psychology and CBT used in this intervention could be applied to a wide range of chronic conditions, making the impact of this study potentially broad across healthcare fields dealing with long-term conditions​(5).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The HOPE: MS intervention is designed to be scalable. Its group-based format and the ability to train facilitators in self-management techniques make it adaptable for larger populations or for expansion to different regions​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Transferability: The model can be transferred to other chronic diseases where self-management is crucial, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or even cancer survivorship programs, thus expanding its applicability beyond MS​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The integration of positive psychology with CBT in a self-management context is innovative. By focusing on cultivating positive emotions like hope and gratitude, the intervention introduces a novel approach to managing the psychological challenges of living with MS​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption: The program has the potential to disrupt traditional healthcare models by shifting some of the responsibility for managing chronic conditions from healthcare professionals to the patients themselves, promoting patient autonomy​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The HOPE: MS program is sustainable as it trains peer facilitators, allowing the intervention to be delivered continuously at a low cost. It also fosters long-term self-management, reducing the burden on healthcare systems​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: Ethically, the program respects patient autonomy by empowering individuals to take control of their health. It also provides equitable access to support by using group-based and peer-led models, ensuring that participants feel understood and supported by others with similar experiences​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
Implementation: The study has demonstrated that the HOPE: MS intervention is feasible and easy to implement in community settings. The peer-facilitated format and the comprehensive training for facilitators ensure the program can be adopted and scaled with fidelity​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Usability: Participants in the study found the program to be user-friendly and beneficial, with high levels of satisfaction reported regarding the content and delivery of the intervention​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The intervention draws on insights from psychology, public health, and rehabilitation, making it relevant across these disciplines. The focus on both mental and physical health ensures that it has applications in multiple sectors of healthcare​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: Given that MS is a global issue, the intervention has relevance for international healthcare systems. The program could be adapted to different cultural and healthcare contexts worldwide, especially where there is a need for scalable self-management solutions for chronic conditions​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience: The HOPE: MS program is resilient because it can be delivered in a variety of settings, including online or in-person, allowing it to continue in times of crisis, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic​(5).
Adaptability: The intervention is adaptable to different types of MS (e.g., relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive) and could be further adapted for other chronic diseases, making it a flexible tool for healthcare providers​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
