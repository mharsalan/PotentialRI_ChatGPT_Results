Based on the information from the attached study, I will now provide a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions as per my knowledge and the predefined instructions. This assessment considers both the pre-publication and post-publication stages and evaluates the research's overall impact across multiple domains.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Health Domain: The study focuses on improving the self-management of long-term conditions (LTCs) such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, diabetes, and musculoskeletal pain. The health impact is evident in the significant improvements in patient activation, self-management skills, quality of life, and reductions in depression and anxiety​(2).
Social Domain: The program enhances patients' involvement in their healthcare, improving their confidence and ability to manage chronic conditions. This social impact empowers patients to take an active role in their health, influencing social behavior towards greater self-reliance​(2).
Policy Domain: The findings support self-management as a central element of national healthcare policies, such as those in the NHS. This can influence policy development by integrating self-management programs into healthcare systems as a standard practice​(2).
Educational Domain: The study contributes to educational impact by providing healthcare professionals and peer tutors with skills in patient activation and co-delivery of self-management programs, which can be further integrated into health education​(2).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: The program shows immediate benefits in terms of patient activation, anxiety reduction, and health-related quality of life within six months of completion​(2).
Long-term Impact: The self-management skills acquired through the program can have long-lasting effects, with patients likely to continue using these skills in managing their conditions. This also has implications for reducing long-term healthcare costs by decreasing reliance on direct clinical care​(2).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders: Patients with long-term conditions (COPD, depression, diabetes, musculoskeletal pain), healthcare providers (such as clinicians and peer tutors), and national health organizations like the NHS.
Indirect Stakeholders: Policymakers who are responsible for healthcare frameworks, and educational institutions that may integrate this self-management model into health curricula​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth: The research profoundly influences patient self-management in the specific context of LTCs, with a clear impact on health outcomes such as patient activation and psychological well-being​(2).
Breadth: The co-delivery model's success, which pairs healthcare professionals with lay tutors, could be applied to other chronic conditions and even expanded to different healthcare systems globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The study demonstrates the potential for the program to be scaled across different NHS sites, given the positive results. It can be expanded to a broader population of patients with long-term conditions​(2).
Transferability: The model is transferable to different healthcare contexts beyond the UK, as it applies to a wide range of chronic conditions. The self-management approach can also be adapted to non-healthcare sectors such as social work and education​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The program introduces an innovative co-delivery approach that combines peer support and professional healthcare guidance. This integration disrupts traditional clinician-led care models by giving patients greater ownership of their health​(2).
Disruption: The study challenges existing models of healthcare delivery by promoting patient-led management, potentially leading to a shift away from reliance on professional healthcare providers alone​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability: The program promotes sustainable healthcare by enabling patients to manage their conditions, thereby reducing long-term healthcare service demands. This aligns with the goal of creating more efficient, patient-driven healthcare models​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Ethical Considerations: The co-production model respects patient autonomy and promotes equality by valuing both professional and patient input. This ethical approach fosters mutual respect and encourages patient participation in their own care​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
The study demonstrates that the self-management program is easily implementable in real-world healthcare settings, as evidenced by its successful delivery across multiple NHS sites. Its usability is further enhanced by its adaptable structure, which allows for tailored interventions specific to each LTC​(2).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Cross-disciplinary Impact: The study's co-delivery model incorporates elements of social work, psychology, and healthcare, making it relevant across multiple fields. The intervention can be adapted for other disciplines where patient engagement is critical​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Global Relevance: The global increase in non-communicable diseases makes this self-management model highly relevant for international healthcare systems dealing with rising chronic disease burdens​(2).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The co-produced SMP shows resilience as it adapts to different patient populations and settings, such as those with varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Its adaptability ensures it can be tailored to address different LTCs and patient needs, making it robust in diverse healthcare environments​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
