Based on the text you've provided and the key dimensions of research impact from the Knowledge document, here's a detailed analysis of the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact applied to the study titled "A Co-Produced Self-Management Programme Improves Psychosocial Outcomes for People Living with Depression":

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Improvements in activation, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and self-management skills suggest that the SMP could make a useful contribution to recovery services in mental health." (Discussion, page 18)
Domains Covered: The research spans multiple domains:
Health: Directly influences mental health interventions and patient recovery.
Social: Encourages peer-support, co-production, and patient involvement.
Policy: Could influence healthcare services through the introduction of self-management practices.
Educational: Offers insights into patient education regarding self-management.
Example: By focusing on co-produced self-management programs, this research can inform national healthcare systems on patient-centric, sustainable mental health services.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Patient activation significantly improved 6 months after the SMP, showing lasting effects on patients’ mental health." (Results, page 17)
Categories:
Short-term Impact: Immediate benefits such as improvements in patient health, anxiety, and quality of life were observed within six months.
Long-term Impact: The sustainability of self-management practices and empowerment of patients could reduce long-term healthcare service dependency.
Example: The research provides a foundation for future interventions and services, indicating long-lasting benefits in mental health recovery.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Participants recognized the value of the peer tutors’ life experience and the medical expertise of the health practitioner." (Discussion, page 19)
Direct Stakeholders:
Patients: Benefit from improved psychosocial outcomes.
Healthcare Providers: Gain a new, low-cost therapy option.
Indirect Stakeholders:
Policymakers: Could use this model to enhance national mental health strategies.
Educational Institutions: Can integrate these findings into health education curricula.
Example: Patients are empowered as equal partners in mental health services, improving community-level mental health management.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Improvements in activation, depression, anxiety, and quality of life suggest deep impacts on patient outcomes." (Results, page 17)
Depth: Deep impact on mental health by directly improving depression, anxiety, and self-management among patients.
Breadth: Broad implications for health service design, patient empowerment, and cross-sector collaborations (mental health, education, policy).
Example: The research not only impacts individual health outcomes but also informs national mental health policies, expanding its influence across multiple sectors.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The SMP can be embedded in the existing pathway of care at relatively low cost." (Conclusions, page 22)
Scalability: The program's low-cost design makes it scalable across broader healthcare settings, such as within the NHS.
Transferability: The principles of co-production and peer support can be transferred to other chronic disease management programs.
Example: This study could lead to a national implementation of co-produced self-management programs, scaling up across mental health and chronic disease care.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The co-produced depression SMP is innovative in a UK mental health setting." (Abstract, page 1)
Innovation: Introducing co-production and peer support as key components of mental health services.
Disruption: The approach challenges traditional mental health service models, promoting patient involvement as co-creators of their care.
Example: This research could disrupt existing mental health care practices by fostering greater patient empowerment and reducing reliance on clinician-led care.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The SMP offers a sustainable and ethical model for patient care, with patients actively contributing to their own health management." (Discussion, page 20)
Sustainability: The self-management model encourages long-term mental health recovery, reducing long-term service dependency.
Ethical Considerations: The co-production method addresses ethical concerns by valuing patients as equal partners in healthcare.
Example: The research promotes sustainable healthcare practices by empowering patients, aligning with ethical standards of patient autonomy.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The SMP can be integrated into the existing care pathways without significant additional costs, making it highly usable in practical settings." (Conclusions, page 22)
Example: The research’s findings are immediately applicable, providing mental health services with a scalable, easy-to-implement program for depression management.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "This study could influence other long-term condition management programs." (Discussion, page 19)
Cross-disciplinary Impact: This model can apply to chronic conditions beyond depression, impacting areas like diabetes and COPD management.
Global Relevance: As mental health challenges are universal, the co-production approach can be adapted globally.
Example: The approach’s relevance spans healthcare, education, and policy sectors, offering a framework that can be adapted across countries.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The SMP’s flexible delivery model, co-facilitated by peer and professional tutors, ensures adaptability across different healthcare settings." (Methods, page 10)
Resilience: The program fosters resilient mental health recovery by building patient self-efficacy and activation.
Adaptability: It can be adapted to various healthcare environments, whether in community or hospital settings.
Example: This model is highly adaptable and resilient, able to be customized for different patient populations and healthcare systems.
