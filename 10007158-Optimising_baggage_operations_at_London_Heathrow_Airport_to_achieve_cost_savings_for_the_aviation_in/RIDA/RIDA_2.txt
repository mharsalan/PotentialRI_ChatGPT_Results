I will now analyze the attached study titled "SUPPLY CHAIN SCHEDULING: BATCHING AND DELIVERY" by Nicholas G. Hall and Chris N. Potts for its research impact dimensions based on the guidelines you have provided. Here's a detailed dimension-by-dimension analysis based on the text in the paper.

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain... This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, each of which is delivered to the next downstream stage as a single shipment." (Introduction, p. 566)
"We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective." (Introduction, p. 566)
Example:

Academic Domain: The research contributes significantly to the academic domain of operations research by advancing scheduling and batching theory within supply chain management.
Economic Domain: The practical implications of cost reductions in supply chains can influence industrial practices, potentially reducing logistics expenses in manufacturing sectors.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The results show that cooperation between supplier and manufacturer can lead to significant cost reductions in supply chains, sometimes up to 100% for specific scheduling objectives." (Results, p. 570)
"We also describe and analyze models for cooperative decision making between the supplier and the manufacturer." (Discussion, p. 570)
Example:

Long-Term Impact: The models developed for cooperative decision-making between suppliers and manufacturers lay a foundation for future studies and improvements in supply chain efficiency, potentially influencing long-term strategies in logistics and operations.
Page Reference: Results, p. 570; Discussion, p. 570

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The supplier may be reluctant to deliver very frequently because of the resulting high delivery cost. Furthermore, the manufacturer may prefer to receive parts earlier... However, the scheduling decisions must be coordinated with related batching and delivery decisions." (Introduction, p. 567)
Example:

Direct Stakeholders: Industry professionals in supply chain management, particularly logistics managers, would benefit from the findings by adopting the cooperative scheduling models to reduce costs.
Indirect Stakeholders: Companies implementing these strategies may pass cost savings to consumers, reducing product prices or improving service quality.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"This paper uses the batch availability assumption. Research on problems in which jobs are delivered to customers in batches is limited." (Introduction, p. 567)
Example:

Deep Impact: The paper makes a profound contribution to the field of supply chain scheduling by addressing uncoordinated decision-making inefficiencies, offering new models for cost reduction that advance current academic understanding.
Broad Impact: The research is applicable across industries reliant on supply chains (e.g., manufacturing, retail, and distribution), influencing policies on batch deliveries and cooperation within supply chains.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 567

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable." (Introduction, p. 566)
Example:

Scalability: The dynamic programming models can be scaled to larger, more complex supply chains involving multiple suppliers and manufacturers, making them applicable to global supply chain networks.
Transferability: The models could be transferred to other industries beyond manufacturing, such as healthcare or logistics, where scheduling and cost minimization are critical.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains." (Introduction, p. 566)
Example:

The research introduces innovative models that challenge traditional approaches to uncoordinated decision-making in supply chains, potentially disrupting conventional logistics strategies by promoting cooperative scheduling and batch processing.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 566

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective." (Introduction, p. 566)
Example:

By optimizing supply chain coordination, the research promotes sustainability through resource efficiency (e.g., reduced energy consumption and emissions from fewer deliveries), contributing to environmental sustainability in logistics.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 566

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%." (Introduction, p. 566)
Example:

The models proposed are highly implementable for businesses looking to improve cost-efficiency in supply chains. Companies can apply these models directly to optimize batch deliveries and reduce costs.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 566

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"More extensive surveys can be found in Potts and Van Wassenhove (1992), Webster and Baker (1995), and Potts and Kovalyov (2000). There are two alternative assumptions that may apply for this class of problems." (Introduction, p. 567)
Example:

Global Relevance: The study's findings on supply chain cost reductions are relevant to global logistics and can be adapted for use in international trade and cross-border manufacturing networks.
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 567

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"An important example of decision making that affects both a supplier and a manufacturer is the delivery process between them... However, because of production constraints at the supplier, its scheduling decisions may prioritize the processing of certain parts." (Introduction, p. 567)
Example:

The research promotes adaptability by providing flexible models that can adjust to different supply chain configurations and constraints, enhancing the resilience of businesses to changes in demand or production capacity.
