I have analyzed the content of the research study provided ("Making Italian Espresso, Making Espresso Italian") by Jonathan Morris, as well as the attached "Knowledge - Potential RI by Dimensions" file, which outlines the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact." Below is the research impact assessment based on these dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"This article examines the processes by which espresso became ‘Italian’ over the course of the twentieth century by investigating the way that the taste of Italian coffee has evolved, along with the taste for coffee amongst the Italians." (Abstract, Page 1)
"By focusing on the sensory qualities of the coffee itself, it aims to produce a material history of espresso that can be read alongside that of the socio-cultural conditions that have occasioned its success." (Abstract, Page 1)
Page Reference: Abstract, Page 1

Example: The study contributes to multiple domains including the academic domain (history of coffee and consumer taste evolution), cultural domain (the role of coffee in national identity and Italian culture), and economic domain (the commercial evolution of coffee machines and global coffee consumption patterns).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The history of coffee in Italy long predates that of espresso. Venice was one of the first ports to begin importing coffee into Europe from the 1570s..." (Historical Background, Page 9)
"These parameters have been incorporated into an Italian government Certificate of Product Conformity...allowing brands to display the 'Certified Italian Espresso' trademark on their products." (Page 7)
Page Reference: Pages 7 and 9

Example: The research has both long-term impact by documenting the evolution of espresso and its certification, and short-term impact by influencing modern branding practices in the coffee industry (e.g., the Italian Espresso Institute certification).

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Espresso is best thought of as neither a type of coffee, nor a form of beverage, but as the outcome of a particular preparation process..." (Making Italian Espresso, Page 7)
Page Reference: Page 7

Example: Direct stakeholders include coffee industry professionals, baristas, and coffee equipment manufacturers who benefit from the defined standards of espresso. Indirect stakeholders include global coffee consumers who experience the cultural and sensory heritage of Italian coffee.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Espresso Italiano is obtained, by definition and by tradition, through an expert blend of coffees of different origin." (Making Italian Espresso, Page 8)
Page Reference: Page 8

Example: The deep impact of this research lies in its contribution to the academic understanding of how espresso became integral to Italian identity. The broad impact includes its influence on global coffee culture, particularly the spread of Italian coffeehouse models.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"What is striking about these statements is that Italian espresso is presented as an unchanging, static beverage, whose 'original' features have been established by 'tradition'." (Making Italian Espresso, Page 8)
Page Reference: Page 8

Example: Scalability can be seen in how Italian espresso standards are now used globally, influencing coffee preparation methods worldwide. Transferability is evident in the way Italian coffee culture has been adapted for various global markets, influencing not just the beverage industry but also consumer behavior.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"In 1998 an Italian National Espresso Institute (INEI) was established to evaluate the sensory profile of an 'Italian espresso' and define the parameters under which this could be produced." (Making Italian Espresso, Page 7)
Page Reference: Page 7

Example: The establishment of the INEI represents an innovation in setting coffee industry standards, influencing how espresso is defined and produced globally. This standardization disrupted traditional coffee-making practices by introducing a regulated, certified approach to espresso preparation.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Coffee passes through so many hands on its journey from bean to cup that it is very difficult for any one element in this chain to exercise close control over the experiential taste of the eventual beverage." (Page 2)
Page Reference: Page 2

Example: While not directly focused on sustainability, the research highlights the economic and ethical considerations of global coffee trade, including the challenges of consistent taste production and the impact of blending methods on coffee sourcing.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"The Italian government Certificate of Product Conformity allows businesses to display the 'Certified Italian Espresso' trademark." (Page 7)
Page Reference: Page 7

Example: The study's findings on certification have direct usability for coffee producers and cafés in adopting practices that meet official standards for making authentic Italian espresso, enhancing consumer trust and product branding.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The same blend of coffee beans can taste substantially different, depending on the method of beverage preparation and serving style adopted." (Page 4)
Page Reference: Page 4

Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance by combining insights from history, sociology, and culinary arts, and global relevance as it influences how espresso is prepared and consumed worldwide.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Each step in this evolution has seen substantial shifts in the sensory profile of what has been served as 'espresso' and the styles in which it has been consumed." (Page 8)
Page Reference: Page 8

Example: The research shows resilience in how espresso has adapted to changing technological and cultural conditions, illustrating how a national beverage can evolve while maintaining its core identity across decades.
