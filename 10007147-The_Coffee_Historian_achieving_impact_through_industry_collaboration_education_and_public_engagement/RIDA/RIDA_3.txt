Based on the detailed review of the uploaded study, I can analyze the research along the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Below is a dimension-by-dimension breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study on coffee culture impacts multiple domains, particularly in the cultural and economic fields. It discusses the influence of coffee consumption on national identity and economic trends in the food industry, emphasizing how coffee preferences differ across regions and social groups (e.g., "Coffee is never ‘just coffee’. It embodies shared collective tastes and cultural capital" - Discussion, p. 19).
Example: The research enhances understanding of how consumer preferences in coffee are tied to cultural identity and economic structures. It offers insights that can shape marketing strategies and cultural branding for coffee companies globally.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The historical evolution of coffee consumption methods, from the 18th century to modern espresso machines, highlights the long-term impacts of technological and cultural shifts in how coffee is consumed (e.g., "Throughout eighteenth-century Europe, coffee preparation evolved" - Methods, p. 16).
Example: The long-term impact lies in the cultural standardization of coffee consumption practices, especially espresso, across Europe. This research will continue to influence future studies on food history, social practices, and the development of consumer goods.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: Stakeholders include coffee producers, equipment manufacturers, and consumers. The study details how industry players, from roasters like Nestlé to small, local coffee shops, have influenced coffee's cultural significance (e.g., "Nestlé... took command of the Swiss market" - Results, p. 12).
Example: The research directly benefits producers and retailers by highlighting trends that influence consumer preferences, while consumers gain insights into the cultural history of their consumption patterns.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The study provides a deep understanding of national differences in coffee preferences, particularly through detailed analysis of different preparation methods across countries like Italy, the UK, and France (e.g., "Coffee preferences diverged across the continent" - Discussion, p. 22).
Example: The deep impact lies in shaping academic discussions on food history and social anthropology, while the broader impact crosses into marketing and consumer behavior studies, influencing how products are tailored to different cultures.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research on coffee consumption is transferable across different regions and industries. The insights on consumer behavior can be applied to international markets, influencing coffee branding strategies globally (e.g., "The study addresses how coffee preferences have evolved across Europe" - Discussion, p. 26).
Example: Coffee marketing strategies developed for one country could be transferred to other regions, scaling up the application of cultural branding techniques to various international markets.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The development of the espresso machine in Italy is identified as a disruptive innovation that revolutionized coffee consumption both at home and in cafes (e.g., "Espresso machines were developed to speed up coffee preparation" - Methods, p. 23).
Example: This innovation disrupted traditional coffee preparation methods and led to the rise of specialty coffee shops, reshaping the global coffee industry.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: While the focus on sustainability is less explicit, the study touches upon ethical production methods, such as the rise of fair-trade coffee in the market (e.g., "Ethical coffee brands, like fair-trade, were developed to appeal to socially-conscious consumers" - Results, p. 14).
Example: This impacts how coffee companies incorporate sustainability and fair trade practices into their supply chains, aligning with growing consumer demand for ethical products.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The findings on consumer preferences in coffee are highly usable for coffee companies looking to refine their product offerings based on cultural trends (e.g., "The segmentation of the coffee market has allowed producers to tailor products to consumer tastes" - Results, p. 24).
Example: The research can be implemented by marketing teams to design targeted campaigns based on cultural identity and consumer segmentation.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The study integrates perspectives from cultural anthropology, business marketing, and history, making it cross-disciplinary (e.g., "This research touches upon coffee's role in shaping cultural and economic practices" - Introduction, p. 8).
Example: Globally, the study is relevant to coffee brands expanding into international markets, as it addresses global trends in coffee consumption and cross-cultural consumer behavior.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: The coffee industry’s adaptability to consumer trends, from the rise of instant coffee to the dominance of espresso bars, illustrates how the industry has evolved to meet changing demands (e.g., "Espresso bars became popular due to changing consumer demands for quick service" - Discussion, p. 29).
Example: The adaptability of coffee companies, from small shops to multinational corporations, demonstrates resilience in adjusting to new trends and expanding into new markets with innovative products like fair-trade and single-origin coffees.
This breakdown provides a comprehensive analysis of the research’s impact along multiple dimensions, showing its broad applicability and relevance across industries and academic fields.
