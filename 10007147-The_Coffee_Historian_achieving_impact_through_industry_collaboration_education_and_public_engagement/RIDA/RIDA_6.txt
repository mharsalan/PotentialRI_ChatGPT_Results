Based on the provided research document and relevant text, I will now map the findings to the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact (RI) as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study discusses Fairtrade and other coffee certification schemes and their role in promoting sustainability, ethical consumption, and economic improvement for coffee producers in regions like Latin America and Africa. These certification programs play a role in addressing socioeconomic sustainability and environmental concerns in the coffee industry.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 166-170, Discussion
Example: The research contributes to environmental sustainability (through certifications like Organic and Bird Friendly) and to social and economic domains by improving the income and working conditions of coffee producers. Additionally, the study addresses the policy domain by highlighting the role of government strategies in transforming coffee production (e.g., Rwanda's national coffee strategy).
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The impact of Fairtrade and direct trade models has evolved over time, particularly in Rwanda, where a national coffee strategy and foreign aid transformed the industry from commodity production to specialty coffee, doubling export value.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 169-170, Results
Example: The research outlines both short-term impacts (such as immediate financial improvements for certified producers) and long-term impacts (such as the sustainable transformation of Rwanda’s coffee economy and continued social benefits from Fairtrade initiatives).
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: Stakeholders include producers (who benefit from Fairtrade premiums), consumers (who engage in ethical consumption), and policymakers (who are involved in regulating and certifying Fairtrade and direct trade practices).
Page Reference and Section: Pages 166-170, Discussion
Example: The research primarily impacts coffee producers through certification schemes and consumers through ethical branding. Additionally, international stakeholders such as NGOs and policymakers benefit from insights into sustainable trade practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The study shows how Rwanda’s adoption of washing stations and direct trade transformed its coffee industry, with impacts on both local coffee producers and the global specialty coffee market.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 169-170, Results
Example: Deep impact on the coffee industry in Rwanda, which saw both local improvements in the economy and global recognition as a specialty coffee producer. Broad impact in the global specialty coffee market, influencing coffee consumption trends worldwide.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The coffee certification schemes described in the study have the potential to be scaled and transferred to other agricultural sectors and regions facing similar socioeconomic and environmental challenges.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 166-169, Results
Example: Fairtrade certification, though developed for coffee, could be transferred to other agricultural industries, promoting sustainable practices and ethical trade globally.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The introduction of "direct trade" by third-wave coffee roasters represents a disruptive force within the coffee industry, bypassing traditional Fairtrade models and focusing on direct partnerships with producers.
Page Reference and Section: Page 168, Results
Example: The direct trade model has disrupted traditional coffee trade by focusing on quality and traceability, leading to transformative partnerships between producers and roasters, which could disrupt global trade practices.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research extensively covers sustainability initiatives, such as Fairtrade and organic certifications, which promote sustainable farming practices and ethical labor conditions.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 166-168, Discussion
Example: The study highlights how certifications like Fairtrade contribute to social and environmental sustainability by improving living conditions for producers and promoting biodiversity through eco-friendly farming practices.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: Fairtrade’s pricing structures and certification models are designed to be easily implemented by cooperatives and producer groups, while the direct trade model offers usability for specialty roasters seeking higher-quality products.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 167-169, Discussion
Example: The research shows how cooperatives and smallholders can implement Fairtrade’s requirements to access premium markets, while direct trade models offer usability for high-end specialty roasters.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The research on Fairtrade coffee addresses global challenges such as poverty alleviation, environmental conservation, and sustainable trade, making it relevant across multiple disciplines including economics, environmental science, and global development studies.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 166-169, Discussion
Example: The research has cross-disciplinary relevance as it links global economic development, environmental sustainability, and ethical consumption. It is also globally relevant as the issues discussed affect coffee producers and consumers worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: Rwanda’s coffee sector demonstrated resilience after the 1994 genocide by adapting to the specialty coffee market through the implementation of washing stations and direct trade partnerships, which have made the industry more sustainable.
Page Reference and Section: Pages 169-170, Discussion
Example: The adaptability of Rwanda’s coffee industry, as demonstrated through its national coffee strategy and adoption of specialty coffee practices, ensures the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of its coffee exports in the global market.
This detailed analysis connects the findings from the research with each of the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, providing specific excerpts, section details, and examples for clarity.
