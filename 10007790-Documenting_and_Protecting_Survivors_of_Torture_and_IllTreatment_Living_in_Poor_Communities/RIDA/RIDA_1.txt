Let's assess the paper, "Torture and Ill-Treatment Under Perceived: Human Rights Documentation and the Poor," using the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. Below is the dimension-by-dimension analysis based on the content of the paper:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"This article addresses the question of how human rights practitioners know about harm. In particular, what forms of torture and ill-treatment are made legible through human rights documentation?" (Introduction, page 394)​(1).
The paper explores the failure of human rights documentation to fully capture the experiences of the poor in Kenya, Bangladesh, and Nepal, especially in relation to torture and ill-treatment.
Page Reference: Introduction, page 394​(1).

Example: The study impacts the social domain by highlighting how structural inequalities in human rights documentation affect vulnerable populations living in poverty. It also touches on the policy domain by suggesting potential reforms in the documentation practices of human rights organizations.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"The article is based on research in Kenya, Bangladesh, and Nepal and sets out five key predispositions in documentation techniques that result in implicit discrimination" (Introduction, page 394)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 394​(1).

Example: The research has long-term impact potential as it uncovers systemic flaws in human rights documentation, which can lead to foundational changes in how future human rights work is conducted, especially in how violence against marginalized populations is perceived and recorded.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"The research consisted of interviews with key actors in these organizations, focusing on how they identified survivors, the procedures they used for documentation, and the purposes to which documentation was put." (Methods, page 398)​(1).
Page Reference: Methods, page 398​(1).

Example: The direct stakeholders are human rights practitioners and organizations, who can use this research to reform documentation practices. Indirect stakeholders include impoverished communities in Kenya, Bangladesh, and Nepal, whose experiences of violence might be better documented and addressed as a result of this study.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Several caveats are necessary at this stage... the arguments presented below are based on research on documentation in three low-income urban neighborhoods in Kenya, Nepal, and Bangladesh." (Introduction, page 396)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 396​(1).

Example: The depth of impact is seen in its field-specific contribution to human rights documentation. The breadth of impact comes from its cross-disciplinary relevance to human rights, political science, and development studies, influencing future research on poverty and justice.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"The documentation of torture and ill-treatment particularly so... these techniques result in the under perception of the extent of torture among people living in poverty" (Introduction, page 394)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 394​(1).

Example: This research can be scaled up for application in other low-income regions worldwide, improving human rights practices globally. Its transferability lies in its ability to inform policies beyond the specific contexts of Kenya, Nepal, and Bangladesh, potentially influencing global human rights frameworks.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"The documentation acts as the eyes and ears of the human rights movement. The techniques and assumptions of documentation help set the parameters for how human rights organizations perceive and act in the world." (Introduction, page 394)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 394​(1).

Example: The study introduces an innovative critique of how human rights documentation fails to capture the full extent of torture among the poor, disrupting traditional documentation practices. This disruptive potential could fundamentally change how human rights violations are documented, moving towards more inclusive and equitable approaches.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The poor here are understood as being individuals and households marked not only by a lack of income but also a lack of opportunities in key areas of education, health, and democratic processes." (Introduction, page 395)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 395​(1).

Example: The research highlights ethical concerns in human rights documentation, pointing out how current practices neglect marginalized populations. It also underscores the need for sustainable documentation techniques that can better serve vulnerable communities.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"This article outlines how the assumptions and institutional capacities of human rights organizations can result in at least five linked conceptual and institutional predispositions." (Introduction, page 396)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 396​(1).

Example: The research provides usable insights for human rights organizations, enabling them to implement reforms in documentation methods. It also offers practical tools for organizations to become more inclusive in their approaches to documenting human rights violations.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"The findings from our research... are potentially applicable to other poor communities, where access to human rights organizations can be equally, if not more limited." (Introduction, page 396)​(1).
Page Reference: Introduction, page 396​(1).

Example: The study has cross-disciplinary relevance to human rights, law, development studies, and social justice. Its findings have global implications, suggesting reforms that could benefit marginalized populations worldwide, beyond the specific focus on Kenya, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"We conclude with some practical implications of our argument." (Conclusion, page 397)​(1).
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 397​(1).

Example: The research demonstrates resilience in addressing the persistent issue of under-perception in human rights documentation. It offers adaptable strategies that can be applied in various contexts, ensuring human rights organizations remain responsive to the evolving needs of vulnerable populations.
