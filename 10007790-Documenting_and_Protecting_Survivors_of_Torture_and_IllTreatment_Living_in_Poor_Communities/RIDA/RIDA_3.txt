Based on your provided research paper and focusing on the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, here’s an assessment of the key impacts aligned with each dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt:
“The research documents widespread and long-term abuses, particularly in Kenya, Bangladesh, and Nepal, highlighting the challenges human rights practitioners face in documenting torture and ill-treatment.”

Page Reference: Methods, page 63​(3).
Example:
This research impacts the policy domain by identifying and addressing human rights abuses and can influence international policy frameworks around human rights documentation. It also impacts the social domain by addressing the social issues related to state-led violence and documenting these for public and institutional awareness.

2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt:
“The documentation process highlights the ongoing need for human rights advocacy and raises the awareness of political and social groups in each of these case studies.”

Page Reference: Results, page 67​(3).
Example:
The research has long-term impact as it lays the groundwork for ongoing discussions in international human rights, potentially influencing policies and legal frameworks over decades by shaping how torture and ill-treatment are reported and addressed globally.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt:
“The main organizations involved in the documentation of torture were invited to stakeholder workshops where objectives and methods were discussed and feedback was provided.”

Page Reference: Methods, page 63​(3).
Example:
Direct stakeholders include NGOs, medical professionals, and legal bodies who directly use the research for advocacy, litigation, and policy reforms. Indirect stakeholders are the public and future generations benefiting from improved human rights standards.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt:
“This research explored the perceptions and challenges human rights practitioners face in documenting torture or ill-treatment and examined how instruments like the Istanbul Protocol are applied.”

Page Reference: Results and Discussion, page 64​(3).
Example:
This research has deep impact within the field of human rights advocacy by improving documentation methods, specifically through the Istanbul Protocol. It also has broad impact across legal and medical sectors, influencing how evidence is gathered and utilized in international human rights cases.

5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt:
“The research identified methods and documentation tools that could be expanded to other regions facing similar political instability and human rights challenges.”

Page Reference: Results, page 64​(3).
Example:
The research can be scaled up for broader application in other low-income countries or conflict zones facing similar human rights issues. It can also be transferred to other areas of advocacy, such as refugee rights, extending the impact across global human rights sectors.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt:
“This research questions the effectiveness of detailed documentation where legal systems are unresponsive, pushing for more advocacy-oriented approaches.”

Page Reference: Results, page 67​(3).
Example:
The research introduces innovation by promoting the use of less time-intensive, more flexible documentation methods. It disrupts traditional approaches by suggesting that comprehensive documentation may not always be effective in environments with limited legal response, shifting the focus to advocacy.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt:
“The research process underwent an ethical audit and review, ensuring the confidentiality and safety of participants, particularly in politically hostile environments.”

Page Reference: Methods, page 64​(3).
Example:
The project ensures sustainability by advocating for long-term human rights monitoring and ethical considerations by maintaining participant anonymity and aligning with human rights ethical standards, particularly in volatile regions.

8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt:
“The findings informed the development of training programs and educational projects aimed at improving human rights documentation and medical reporting in low-income countries.”

Page Reference: Results and Discussion, page 67​(3).
Example:
The research has high usability as it provides practical tools and insights for human rights organizations to implement improved documentation techniques, especially in regions with limited resources.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt:
“The research involved collaborations with human rights organizations, medical professionals, and legal experts across three different countries, showing the interdisciplinary nature of the study.”

Page Reference: Methods, page 63​(3).
Example:
This research is cross-disciplinary, integrating legal, medical, and social sectors. It also holds global relevance, providing a framework applicable to other countries struggling with state-led violence and human rights abuses.

10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt:
“The documentation practices adapted to the political challenges in each region, such as in Bangladesh where political tensions prevented stakeholder workshops, requiring alternative methods for identifying interviewees.”

Page Reference: Methods, page 63​(3).
Example:
The research demonstrates resilience by adapting its methods to political tensions and limitations, ensuring that documentation and research can still proceed in politically hostile environments.

These assessments detail the research’s alignment with the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact, highlighting its practical, interdisciplinary, and long-term implications for global human rights documentation and advocacy.
