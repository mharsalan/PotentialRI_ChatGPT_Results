To assess the research impact dimensions for the study "The Struggle Against Torture: Challenges, Assumptions, and New Directions" by Tobias Kelly, I'll evaluate the study across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact based on the document you provided. Here are the insights:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The study explores how widespread assumptions about torture (e.g., detention-based, political detainees as victims, legal reform as the solution) may limit our understanding of state violence and how it impacts marginalized groups. It calls for a shift to focus on inequality and extra-custodial violence.

Page Reference: Abstract and discussion, pages 1–10.
Example: This research informs human rights policy and advocacy by highlighting the gaps in current anti-torture strategies, influencing legal, social, and political domains to create more inclusive policies for marginalized communities.
2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: The research highlights that the assumptions of the past 50 years in the fight against torture, while significant, now need a shift. It emphasizes the need for ongoing adaptation as torturers develop new strategies to avoid detection.

Page Reference: Discussion, page 9.
Example: The research has long-term implications by calling for systemic changes in how human rights organizations approach torture, influencing future legal reforms and monitoring mechanisms to keep up with evolving state violence tactics.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: The primary stakeholders include human rights organizations, legal bodies, policymakers, and marginalized groups who are most affected by extra-custodial violence.

Page Reference: Introduction and discussion, pages 2–9.
Example: Policymakers and human rights organizations can directly benefit by reformulating their strategies to address non-traditional torture cases, while marginalized communities benefit from better protection and advocacy.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: The study challenges deep-rooted assumptions in the field of human rights and advocates for a broader understanding of state violence. It suggests that focusing solely on detention centers misses the wider context of torture in everyday public spaces.

Page Reference: Discussion, pages 8–9.
Example: The research has a broad impact by influencing multiple sectors, including human rights law, social justice movements, and international policy discussions on how to address human rights abuses beyond traditional detention settings.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: The arguments presented can be transferred to different contexts where state violence occurs, such as street violence by law enforcement against vulnerable populations in various countries.

Page Reference: Discussion, pages 7–9.
Example: The research’s insights on non-detention violence can be transferred to multiple regions worldwide, including addressing police brutality in both developed and developing countries.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: The study calls for a paradigm shift in how torture is conceptualized and addressed. It moves beyond the traditional legal and institutional frameworks to a more expansive view that includes social inequalities and corruption.

Page Reference: Discussion, pages 8–10.
Example: The study disrupts traditional human rights practices by suggesting that current monitoring and legal frameworks are insufficient to tackle the broader and evolving scope of state violence.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: The research calls for sustainable approaches to human rights activism that consider the ethical treatment of marginalized groups and the long-term effectiveness of anti-torture measures.

Page Reference: Conclusion, pages 9–10.
Example: By focusing on the intersection of inequality and torture, the research ensures that human rights approaches remain relevant and ethically grounded in addressing broader social injustices.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: The study’s recommendations are implementable through policy reforms that broaden the scope of torture prevention to include extra-custodial violence and address state violence in public settings.

Page Reference: Discussion, pages 9–10.
Example: Human rights organizations and governments can implement these findings by expanding their monitoring systems and legal frameworks to include non-detention spaces, enhancing the usability of these insights in practice.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: The study’s focus on inequality and corruption as drivers of torture opens up interdisciplinary discussions involving sociology, law, political science, and ethics.

Page Reference: Throughout the paper, especially discussion, pages 7–10.
Example: The research has global relevance by influencing human rights practices across different cultural and legal contexts, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration to address the multi-faceted nature of state violence.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the need for human rights practices to adapt to evolving forms of state violence, suggesting a more flexible and resilient approach to torture prevention.

Page Reference: Conclusion, pages 9–10.
Example: By advocating for adaptable strategies, the research ensures that anti-torture efforts remain effective in the face of changing state tactics and social dynamics, contributing to the resilience of human rights movements.
These insights provide a comprehensive analysis of the research's impact across key dimensions, aligning with the top 10 research impact criteria outlined.
