Based on the study "A comparative study of the use of the Istanbul Protocol amongst civil society organizations in low-income countries," I have assessed its potential research impacts across several key dimensions as outlined in the document you provided.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The IP provides a useful framework for documentation, but more comprehensive forms of documentation will often be limited to a very small – albeit important - number of legal cases" (Results, page 62).
Impact Example: This study primarily impacts the human rights domain by advancing understanding of how the Istanbul Protocol is applied in different legal and civil society settings. Additionally, it contributes to the policy domain, by informing international and local human rights policies, particularly on torture documentation practices.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpt: "The conclusions of the paper are that the Istanbul Protocol provides a useful framework for documentation, but... in the absence of legal systems willing and able to respond effectively to allegations of torture and ill-treatment, there are severe limitations on the practical effectiveness of detailed and technical forms of documentation" (Results, page 62).
Impact Example: This research has both short-term impact (immediate applications in human rights organizations and advocacy campaigns) and long-term impact (it may shape future revisions of torture documentation standards or legal practices related to human rights violations in the long term).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpt: "In all three case studies, interviewees reported that victims can be extremely reluctant to report their experiences... there is a widespread fear of negative, perhaps even violent reprisals for torture survivors" (Results, page 68).
Impact Example: The research directly benefits civil society organizations (CSOs) and human rights practitioners in low-income countries who engage in the documentation of torture. Indirectly, it impacts government bodies and policymakers who may adjust their legal frameworks and response mechanisms based on these findings.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "The IP is explicitly designed to outline ‘minimum standards for States’... The most comprehensive forms of documentation set out in the IP are resource-intensive" (Introduction, page 61).
Impact Example: The research has deep impact in the field of human rights documentation by offering a critical examination of how standardized protocols like the IP function in resource-poor settings. It also demonstrates breadth of impact by contributing to discussions in legal, health (through medico-legal documentation), and policy domains internationally.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "In all three case studies, levels of awareness about the IP varied amongst human rights practitioners... there has been a programme of training in the use of the IP, funded by international donors" (Results, page 67).
Impact Example: The research is scalable as the documentation and training methodologies discussed can be implemented in other low-income countries with similar contexts. Its transferability applies to various sectors like legal education, medical documentation, and international human rights frameworks.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "More broadly, the research addresses the challenges raised by attempts at standardisation in human rights work. Any move towards standardisation treads a careful line between principles... and detailed guidelines that become too inflexible" (Discussion, page 62).
Impact Example: The study introduces innovative insights by challenging the existing rigid application of the Istanbul Protocol, advocating for more flexible approaches based on context-specific demands. It has disruption potential by suggesting alternative documentation practices that may reshape how human rights organizations operate in low-income countries.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "In the absence of legal systems willing and able to respond effectively to allegations of torture... comprehensive documentation might not always be the most effective way of achieving the broader goals of human rights organisations" (Discussion, page 62).
Impact Example: The research underscores the ethical considerations involved in documenting torture and human rights abuses, highlighting the risks to victims and practitioners. It also advocates for sustainable approaches to human rights documentation that are adaptable to resource constraints.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The practical impact of comprehensive forms of documentation will often be limited to a small – albeit important - number of legal cases... documentation is more likely to be used for advocacy or rehabilitation than legal complaints" (Discussion, page 62).
Impact Example: The findings can be implemented by human rights NGOs for advocacy, education, and rehabilitation programs. Its usability lies in guiding these organizations on how to adapt the Istanbul Protocol for real-world, practical applications in diverse legal and social environments.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "The Protocol has been recommended by the UN General Assembly, the UN Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment" (Introduction, page 61).
Impact Example: The research has global relevance, influencing international human rights bodies and providing cross-disciplinary impact across fields like law, medicine, and international relations. Its findings may inform global discussions on torture prevention and rehabilitation.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "In practice, few interviewees reported that their organizations followed the IP in any level of detail, although it remains a ‘framework’... given limitations of time and resources, IP principles have been adapted to ‘local conditions’" (Results, page 67).
Impact Example: This research promotes resilience and adaptability in human rights work, showing how organizations in low-income countries can modify and apply the Istanbul Protocol in ways that fit their local contexts and available resources.
These dimensions encapsulate the various ways in which the study contributes to its field and broader societal, policy, and legal implications.
