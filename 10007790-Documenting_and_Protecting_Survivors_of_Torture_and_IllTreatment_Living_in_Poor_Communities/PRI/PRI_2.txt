After thoroughly reviewing the study "The Struggle Against Torture: Challenges, Assumptions, and New Directions" and synthesizing insights from various research impact dimensions, I will now present the most relevant potential research impacts for this study, organized by types of impact. These impacts are based on predefined instructions and the study’s focus on torture, inequality, and state violence.

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Knowledge and Theory: The study challenges long-standing assumptions about torture, such as its being primarily detention-based, and expands the theoretical understanding of state violence by highlighting extra-custodial torture. It proposes new avenues of research that focus on marginalized groups outside of detention settings, thus potentially influencing future academic debates in sociology, human rights law, political science, and criminology​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cross-disciplinary Influence: By linking torture to broader issues of social inequality and corruption, the study encourages interdisciplinary research across human rights, political science, social justice studies, and legal reforms. This could lead to the development of new theoretical frameworks that address state violence more comprehensively​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Societal and Policy Impact
Policy Reform and Advocacy: The study's call for a rethinking of torture prevention could influence legal and human rights policies by encouraging governments and international bodies to broaden their definitions of torture to include extra-custodial violence. It may serve as a foundation for advocacy campaigns aimed at reforming national and international human rights laws​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Influence on Human Rights Advocacy: Human rights organizations can adopt the findings to advocate more effectively for victims of state violence who fall outside traditional frameworks of torture. This may shift the focus from political detainees to everyday citizens, influencing social movements and policy initiatives aimed at addressing police brutality and other forms of state violence​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Health and Well-being Impact
Mental and Physical Health of Marginalized Groups: By highlighting the intersection of torture and inequality, the study may contribute to the development of interventions aimed at addressing the psychological and physical trauma experienced by victims of non-detention torture. This could lead to better mental health support systems for marginalized communities​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Social Justice and Equity in Healthcare: The study’s focus on overlooked victims of torture may influence public health policies by pushing for more inclusive healthcare provisions that cater to victims of state violence. This could reduce health disparities for vulnerable populations affected by such violence​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Cultural and Social Impact
Changing Public Attitudes: The study could influence public discourse by raising awareness about the broader, often hidden, aspects of state-sponsored violence. This may help shift societal perceptions of torture from a narrow focus on political detainees to a broader understanding of violence against marginalized populations in non-detention settings​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Behavioral and Social Change: Research findings may encourage behavioral changes within law enforcement agencies, pushing them to adopt more ethical practices that reduce the risk of torture and other forms of state violence. Public engagement with the findings could also increase demand for greater accountability from state actors​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Environmental and Ethical Considerations
Ethical Frameworks for Torture Prevention: The study's emphasis on social inequality introduces ethical considerations into the discourse on torture. By focusing on marginalized communities, it advocates for more equitable approaches to human rights protection, ensuring that anti-torture measures do not further marginalize vulnerable populations​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Sustainability of Human Rights Protections: The study suggests that sustainable human rights practices must evolve to address the changing nature of state violence. This can promote long-term changes in how human rights organizations and governments monitor and prevent torture​(Common Research Impact …).
6. Technological and Monitoring Impact
Innovations in Human Rights Monitoring: The study’s findings can inspire the development of new monitoring tools that capture extra-custodial violence, improving how human rights abuses are detected and documented. This could enhance global efforts to track and prevent torture by state actors​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
7. Economic Impact
Economic Justifications for Policy Change: By linking torture prevention to broader social equity and justice issues, the study could influence economic policies related to law enforcement and social services. Governments may see the long-term economic benefits of preventing torture by reducing legal costs and improving social stability​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. International Collaboration and Global Relevance
Global Human Rights Advocacy: The research offers insights relevant to international human rights bodies like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. It provides a framework that could be adopted globally to address state violence more comprehensively, beyond the boundaries of detention centers​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Cross-border Legal Reforms: The study’s findings could stimulate international dialogue on human rights protections, influencing legal reforms across multiple countries. Its focus on non-detention-based torture is relevant to global conversations on policing, social justice, and governance​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
9. Public Awareness and Education
Educational Curriculum Development: Universities and educational institutions could incorporate the study’s findings into courses on human rights, law, and sociology, thereby shaping future generations of human rights advocates and legal professionals​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Media and Public Engagement: The study may serve as a basis for public awareness campaigns and media discussions that bring attention to overlooked aspects of state violence. This could increase public understanding and drive demand for reform​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
These diverse impacts highlight the study's potential to transform how state violence, torture, and human rights are understood and addressed, both academically and practically, across multiple sectors of society.
