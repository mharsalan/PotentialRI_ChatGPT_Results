Based on my detailed analysis of the study, here are the Potential Research Impacts categorized according to various types of research impact dimensions. Each impact aligns with the findings and implications of the study on the documentation and legal framework surrounding torture in Nepal.

1. Academic Impact:
Contribution to Knowledge: The study offers a significant academic contribution to the understanding of human rights violations, specifically around torture documentation. It advances legal, social, and healthcare methodologies for dealing with survivors.
Cross-disciplinary Influence: The research integrates legal studies, human rights advocacy, public health, and social work, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration on torture survivor care.
Potential for Future Research: This study lays the foundation for further research in human rights law, clinical care for survivors of torture, and policy-making in low-resource countries.
2. Societal Impact:
Legal and Social Advocacy: The research directly benefits NGOs, legal professionals, and human rights advocates by providing actionable insights into how torture claims can be better documented and processed for justice.
Public Awareness and Policy Advocacy: By documenting the challenges faced by torture survivors in seeking compensation, the study informs advocacy efforts and public policy discussions to enhance legal protections and ensure ethical treatment.
Community and Survivor Impact: The findings emphasize the need for societal change regarding how torture survivors are supported, influencing public opinion and potentially reducing social stigma surrounding torture survivors.
3. Policy and Legal Impact:
Influence on Policy: The study provides evidence to push for reforms in the Torture Compensation Act (TCA) in Nepal. This can lead to stronger policies that protect survivors, enforce penalties for human rights violations, and create a better legal pathway for compensation.
Legal Precedent: The research could inform legal cases and set precedents that strengthen the handling of human rights violations in low-resource settings, affecting both national and potentially international human rights policies.
4. Health and Well-being Impact:
Improved Clinical Practices: The research highlights the need for better healthcare systems to handle the medical and psychological needs of torture survivors. It could lead to improvements in clinical guidelines and practices related to trauma care in resource-poor settings.
Enhanced Mental Health Support: Through its discussion on the psychological effects of torture, the research could promote the development of mental health programs aimed at torture survivors, improving their long-term well-being.
5. Economic Impact:
Efficiency in Legal Aid and Healthcare: By identifying gaps in current legal and healthcare support systems, the study could lead to more cost-effective, streamlined services for survivors of torture, potentially lowering the overall cost burden on these systems while improving outcomes.
Potential for Economic Development: The legal reforms suggested by the study could improve access to compensation, which might economically empower survivors and reduce their dependence on limited social services.
6. Environmental and Social Impact:
Social Equity: The study promotes greater social equity by advocating for the marginalized group of torture survivors, pushing for systems that offer more equitable treatment in legal and healthcare contexts.
Cultural Awareness: By documenting cases of torture, the research raises cultural awareness about the importance of addressing human rights violations, helping foster a culture that condemns torture and seeks justice for victims.
7. Technological and Methodological Advancement:
Development of New Documentation Tools: The study could lead to the creation of more effective documentation methods for human rights violations. These tools could be scalable to other countries facing similar issues in tracking and reporting cases of torture or abuse.
Training and Capacity Building: The methodologies for documenting and processing torture cases could be used to train healthcare providers, legal professionals, and NGOs, improving their capacity to support survivors effectively.
8. Resilience and Adaptability:
Adaptation to Local Challenges: The research shows resilience in addressing the systemic and political challenges in Nepal, providing adaptable strategies for NGOs and policymakers to navigate a restrictive environment.
Long-term Influence: This study could have a long-term impact by influencing how legal frameworks evolve to deal with human rights abuses in conflict and post-conflict zones, fostering resilience in legal and social systems.
9. Ethical and Sustainable Practices:
Ethical Considerations: The study emphasizes the need for ethical treatment of torture survivors and highlights how healthcare and legal systems should respect the rights of these individuals.
Sustainable Legal Reform: By proposing changes to the legal framework, the research suggests sustainable reforms that ensure long-term justice for survivors, making the legal system more robust and accountable.
10. Global Relevance and Transferability:
International Human Rights Advocacy: While the research focuses on Nepal, its findings are applicable globally. The documentation and legal recommendations could be transferred to other regions facing similar challenges with human rights violations and weak legal protections.
Scalability: The strategies proposed for documenting and addressing torture survivors' cases can be scaled to international human rights initiatives, improving the global fight against torture and abuse.
These impacts show how the research addresses multiple dimensions, including academic, societal, policy, health, and economic impacts, while promoting equity, ethical practices, and global relevance​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
