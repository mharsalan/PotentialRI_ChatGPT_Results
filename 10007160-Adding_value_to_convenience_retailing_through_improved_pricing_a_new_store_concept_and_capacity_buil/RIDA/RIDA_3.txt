After reviewing the study titled "Intuitive Pricing by Independent Store Managers: Challenging Beliefs and Practices," I have analyzed the research impact dimensions that align with the study’s findings, contributing to various domains of research and practical applications.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Domain:

The study advances academic knowledge in the fields of retail management, consumer behavior, and pricing strategies. By exploring the pricing intuition of independent convenience store managers, it fills a research gap regarding non-formalized pricing processes in small businesses, which is often overlooked in traditional pricing models that focus on larger retailers and corporations​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Social Domain:

The research has significant social implications by examining how independent store managers influence consumer purchasing behaviors, especially in impulse buying situations. It impacts consumer advocacy and public awareness about the transparency and fairness of pricing in small, independent retail environments​(3 (6)).
Economic Domain:

The study has direct economic implications for small business owners, particularly in the convenience store sector. By understanding intuitive pricing strategies, store managers can optimize their pricing to remain competitive against larger retailers, potentially improving profitability and long-term economic sustainability​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact:

In the short term, the research can immediately influence pricing strategies for small retailers by helping them better understand how to align their intuitive pricing with consumer expectations and behavior. This could lead to more effective pricing decisions that maximize customer satisfaction while maintaining profitability​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (6)).
Long-Term Impact:

Over the long term, the findings could contribute to the development of new pricing frameworks specifically designed for small and independent retailers. These frameworks may challenge the dominance of data-driven, formalized pricing methods currently used by large retail chains​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:

Independent convenience store managers are the primary beneficiaries of this research. The study provides them with insights into how their pricing practices are perceived by customers and how they can refine these practices to enhance both sales and customer satisfaction​(3 (6)).
Retail industry consultants and trainers could also benefit from applying the study’s findings to improve training programs for small business owners​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Indirect Stakeholders:

Consumers benefit indirectly through more transparent and fair pricing strategies in the convenience store sector. Better pricing practices could lead to improved consumer trust and loyalty, enhancing the overall retail experience​(3 (6)).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact:

The study has a deep impact within the field of small-scale retail management, as it challenges existing assumptions about how pricing should be structured in independent stores. It provides a new understanding of how non-formalized pricing decisions, based on intuition, can still align with effective retail practices​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Breadth of Impact:

The research has broad implications across multiple fields, such as economics, psychology, and consumer behavior. Its findings can be applied to other small businesses beyond convenience stores, such as restaurants, cafes, and local service providers, where pricing intuition plays a significant role in decision-making​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability:

The research is scalable in that the findings can be applied to larger groups of independent retailers globally, especially in regions where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dominate the retail landscape. The principles of intuitive pricing can be scaled up to apply to various small business formats, including online retail, pop-up stores, and seasonal businesses​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (6)).
Transferability:

The insights gained from this study are highly transferable across different retail sectors, such as hospitality (cafes, small restaurants) and service industries (repair shops, personal care), where similar intuitive decision-making processes in pricing occur​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation:

The study introduces an innovative perspective on pricing by focusing on intuitive, non-data-driven approaches used by small retailers. This challenges traditional models that emphasize formal, analytical pricing methods. The research provides a framework for understanding how heuristics and intuitive processes can lead to successful pricing outcomes​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Disruption:

Although not disruptive in a radical sense, the study could disrupt conventional pricing models by validating the effectiveness of intuition in small-scale retail settings. It provides an alternative to the widespread belief that data analytics is the only path to effective pricing strategies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (6)).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability:

By supporting more sustainable business practices for small retailers, the study encourages pricing strategies that are fair to both consumers and business owners. This contributes to the financial sustainability of small businesses by helping them remain competitive without underpricing or overpricing their products​(3 (6)).
Ethical Considerations:

The study indirectly promotes ethical pricing practices by highlighting the potential pitfalls of overpricing due to intuition and lack of formal data. It raises awareness about the importance of balancing business needs with consumer fairness, contributing to a more ethical retail environment​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability
The findings are highly usable for small business owners and retail managers who seek practical, easy-to-implement insights on pricing. The research can be directly translated into pricing guides or training programs for independent retailers, focusing on how to balance intuition with customer expectations​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research has cross-disciplinary relevance, particularly in marketing, behavioral economics, and consumer psychology. Its global relevance is evident as intuitive pricing practices are commonly found in small businesses worldwide, making it applicable in emerging markets where informal retail dominates​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(3 (6)).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The study’s findings are adaptable to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. As small retailers face increasing pressure from large chains and online platforms, the ability to adapt pricing practices based on intuition and real-time feedback becomes even more valuable​(3 (6))​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Conclusion
The study on intuitive pricing by independent store managers presents a range of potential research impacts, including academic contributions, economic benefits for small businesses, and social influences on consumer behavior. It has a significant depth of impact within the retail sector and broad applicability across other industries. Its scalability and transferability make it relevant globally, particularly in regions where SMEs play a critical role in the economy. The innovative focus on intuition challenges established pricing models, contributing to sustainable business practices and promoting ethical considerations in pricing decisions.
