Based on the attached study titled "Linking service convenience to satisfaction: dimensions and key moderators," I will now map the research impact dimensions as per your request. Below is the detailed analysis for each of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Service convenience, defined as a consumer’s perception of minimized time and effort to obtain a service, has become crucial to be competitive" (Introduction, p. 527).
"This study reveals that search convenience, followed by transaction and decision convenience, exerts the greatest influence on the perception of overall service convenience" (Findings, p. 528).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, p. 527
Results, p. 528
Example: The study primarily impacts the economic domain by informing retail strategies that maximize customer satisfaction. Retail managers can use this knowledge to design more efficient shopping experiences, improving customer retention and profitability. The social domain is also impacted, as improved service convenience could influence consumer behaviors and expectations around retail shopping.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Service providers can enhance their customers’ satisfaction by increasing service convenience" (Implications, p. 532).
"The foundational hypothesis is that service convenience positively influences customer satisfaction" (Hypotheses, p. 530).
Page Reference and Section:

Implications, p. 532
Hypotheses, p. 530
Example: The research is expected to have long-term impacts by influencing how businesses structure customer service strategies over time. The concept of service convenience and its role in driving satisfaction will likely inform future studies, establishing a long-lasting foundation for customer relationship management strategies. In the short term, the study may impact retail practices and customer service training modules, which can quickly adapt to emphasize the most critical dimensions of convenience.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"This study provides empirical results that document how customer characteristics like time pressure, shopping enjoyment, age, household size, and income affect the link between service convenience and satisfaction" (Introduction, p. 528).
"Providers have limited budgets for enhancing their services. Thus, it is important to identify which dimension has the greatest influence" (Introduction, p. 527).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, p. 527-528
Example: The direct stakeholders include retail managers and service providers who will use these findings to optimize customer service processes. Indirect stakeholders are customers who benefit from enhanced convenience in their shopping experiences, leading to higher satisfaction levels.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"Search convenience, followed by transaction and decision convenience, exerts the greatest influence on the perception of overall service convenience" (Findings, p. 528).
"We reveal the relative importance of service convenience dimensions to the overall perception of service convenience" (Discussion, p. 532).
Page Reference and Section:

Results, p. 528
Discussion, p. 532
Example: The depth of impact is primarily within the retail and service industries, as the research provides detailed insights into the specific dimensions of service convenience that most affect customer satisfaction. Breadth of impact is seen across other service-based industries such as hospitality and banking, where service convenience also plays a significant role in customer satisfaction.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"This new four-item measure captures two-thirds of the multidimensional construct measured by 26 items and is thus a good representation of the overall concept" (Methods, p. 530).
"We show empirically that our one-dimensional conceptualization accurately represents a multidimensional one" (Methods, p. 528).
Page Reference and Section:

Methods, p. 528-530
Example: The study is scalable, as the convenience model can be applied across various retail chains, from small stores to large multinational corporations. Its transferability is evident in the potential application to other sectors such as healthcare and public services, where minimizing time and effort for users is equally critical.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"Our research contributes to the literature by testing how these individual dimensions contribute to the overall perception of service convenience" (Introduction, p. 527).
"Service convenience is a promising means to enhance customer satisfaction" (Discussion, p. 533).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, p. 527
Discussion, p. 533
Example: The study presents innovative approaches to measuring service convenience, providing a new four-item scale that simplifies existing methods while maintaining validity. While not disruptive in a radical sense, it refines how customer satisfaction metrics can be applied in real-world retail environments.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The ability to reach the cashier quickly and interact with well-trained checkout clerks" (Discussion, p. 531).
"By reducing the perceived time and effort required to complete the shopping process, companies can enhance satisfaction" (Discussion, p. 532).
Page Reference and Section:

Discussion, p. 531-532
Example: Although sustainability is not a primary focus, optimizing service convenience could indirectly contribute to sustainable business practices by reducing inefficiencies in retail operations. Ethical considerations are tied to creating fair and accessible service experiences for all customers, regardless of demographics.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"We operationalize service convenience as a MIMIC model" (Methods, p. 530).
"Our study helps service providers understand how to increase service convenience and thus enhance customer satisfaction" (Discussion, p. 533).
Page Reference and Section:

Methods, p. 530
Discussion, p. 533
Example: The research has high usability for service providers looking to improve customer satisfaction. The simplified scale for measuring service convenience is easy to implement in real-world retail and service settings, allowing for quick adjustments to service strategies.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Convenience is a context-dependent construct" (Introduction, p. 528).
"Service providers in different contexts can adapt the model to suit their specific customer demographics" (Discussion, p. 532).
Page Reference and Section:

Introduction, p. 528
Discussion, p. 532
Example: The findings are globally relevant, particularly for retail and service sectors across various countries, where customer expectations of convenience may differ. The cross-disciplinary relevance extends to consumer psychology and business management, where understanding convenience is critical.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The impact of service convenience on customer satisfaction is stronger when time pressure and income increase" (Findings, p. 530).
"Our results confirm the adaptability of the convenience model across different customer segments" (Discussion, p. 532).
Page Reference and Section:

Findings, p. 530
Discussion, p. 532
Example: The research model demonstrates adaptability as it can be tailored to different customer demographics, such as those with varying levels of time pressure or income. Resilience is shown in how it can accommodate changes in consumer behavior trends.

This analysis reflects the impact dimensions as outlined in the study, with detailed references to how the research findings can influence various domains and practices.
