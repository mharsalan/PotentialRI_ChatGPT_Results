After thoroughly reviewing the study titled "Retail format selection in on-the-go shopping situations," I have identified several potential research impacts aligned with the instructions and dimensions described in the knowledge base. Below are the potential research impacts based on the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Academic Domain:

The study contributes to the academic understanding of consumer behavior in on-the-go shopping situations, a context that has been understudied compared to traditional, multi-item shopping trips. It introduces new variables such as the urgency of decision-making and the influence of product categories (search goods vs. experience goods) on retail format selection​(2 (6))​(Common Research Impact …).
By integrating multi-attribute utility theory, the study contributes to both marketing theory and retail management literature, influencing further academic research in these domains.
Social Domain:

This research impacts the social domain by offering insights into consumer convenience and decision-making patterns, which are vital for improving the everyday shopping experiences of urban populations. It informs how convenience-based retail formats (like small stores, cafes, and fast-food outlets) serve the needs of a mobile society, helping shape future urban planning strategies​(Common Research Impact …).
Economic Domain:

The findings have economic implications for retailers and convenience store chains by identifying key drivers of retail format selection in on-the-go shopping situations. This can lead to more targeted business strategies aimed at increasing customer retention, enhancing sales, and ultimately improving profitability by leveraging customer behavior data​(Research impact toolkit)​(2 (6)).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-Term Impact:

In the short term, the study can immediately influence retail businesses' operational strategies by providing evidence on what types of retail formats (e.g., convenience stores, fast food) consumers prefer for different types of products (search vs. experience goods) in on-the-go shopping situations​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-Term Impact:

Over the long term, this study could reshape how retail formats are designed and how businesses use consumer behavior insights to innovate new store layouts or service delivery models, with lasting changes to how consumers interact with retail services​(2 (6))​(impact pathway).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Direct Stakeholders:

Retailers and service providers are the primary stakeholders, benefiting from a better understanding of how to cater to consumers in urgent purchasing scenarios. Convenience stores, fast food restaurants, and even e-commerce platforms can apply the insights to attract more on-the-go shoppers by offering streamlined shopping experiences​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Indirect Stakeholders:

Urban planners and local governments could also benefit indirectly by using the findings to influence public policy related to retail zoning and urban development, ensuring that the retail infrastructure is designed to meet the needs of on-the-go consumers​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Depth of Impact:

The depth of impact lies in the retail and consumer behavior field, as this research provides detailed, actionable insights for businesses on how consumers select retail formats for different shopping needs (e.g., urgent food purchases). It offers practical implications for enhancing retail operations​(impact pathway)​(2 (6)).
Breadth of Impact:

The study has broad applications across various sectors such as hospitality, food services, and logistics, where understanding the urgency and convenience needs of consumers can lead to innovations in service delivery. The findings can be applied globally, given that on-the-go shopping is a widespread behavior across many urban centers worldwide​(Common Research Impact …)​(2 (6)).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability:

The findings are scalable to different retail contexts, from small, local convenience stores to large global retail chains. Retailers can use the research to refine their business strategies and optimize store layouts and service offerings to accommodate a larger customer base​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Transferability:

The principles outlined in the study are transferable to other industries, such as healthcare (e.g., walk-in clinics), public transportation, and banking (e.g., quick-service banking). Any industry where convenience and urgency drive consumer behavior can apply these insights​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation:

The study offers an innovative framework by combining multi-attribute utility theory with practical, real-world experiments that showcase how product type (search vs. experience goods) influences shopping format preferences in on-the-go situations. This approach can lead to the development of new business models tailored to urgent, high-utility consumer needs​(impact pathway)​(2 (6)).
Disruption:

While not radically disruptive, the research challenges conventional wisdom about retail behavior in large-basket shopping scenarios. It shifts the focus to micro-shopping experiences, potentially disrupting traditional retail formats by promoting smaller, hyper-convenient outlets that meet consumer needs more efficiently​(2 (6))​(impact pathway).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability:

By promoting smaller, more efficient retail formats (e.g., convenience stores), the research indirectly supports sustainability efforts by minimizing waste in large retail spaces and encouraging the use of local products, reducing the environmental impact of larger supermarkets​(Common Research Impact …).
Ethical Considerations:

The study highlights how certain retail formats can better serve underserved or marginalized populations (e.g., low-income individuals or those with limited mobility), ensuring that businesses cater to diverse consumer needs fairly and ethically​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Implementation and Usability
The research offers high practical usability for businesses in retail, food services, and e-commerce. The clear findings on how different retail formats meet consumer needs in on-the-go situations provide actionable insights that can be immediately implemented in store design, inventory management, and customer service strategies​(Research impact toolkit)​(impact pathway).
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
The research is relevant across disciplines such as marketing, urban planning, and consumer psychology, contributing to a holistic understanding of consumer decision-making in fast-paced environments. Its findings are globally relevant, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions where on-the-go shopping is prevalent​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
The findings demonstrate resilience by being adaptable to various consumer trends and market shifts. As urban mobility and digitalization continue to influence shopping behaviors, the principles of convenience and quick-service formats outlined in the study remain relevant across evolving retail landscapes​(impact pathway)​(Common Research Impact …).
Conclusion
This study offers numerous research impacts across multiple domains, including academic, social, and economic sectors. It provides scalable and transferable insights into how consumers make on-the-go shopping decisions, with long-term implications for business innovation, sustainability, and urban planning. By considering both short-term and long-term pathways, and with focused efforts on promotion and dissemination, this research can achieve substantial, wide-reaching impact across industries and regions.
