To analyze the research paper "Closing the gender pay gap: A review of the issues, policy mechanisms and international evidence" across the top 10 dimensions of research impact, I will follow the structured format outlined in your instructions. Below is the impact assessment by dimension:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research explores gender pay inequality by analyzing various mechanisms such as legal frameworks, social policies, and collective bargaining, affecting labor markets globally. It emphasizes the academic, social, and policy domains.
"This report aims to review the key issues, policy mechanisms and international evidence with respect to closing the gender pay gap." (Introduction, page 1)
The study also evaluates the role of policy, which ties it to economic and legal domains.
"Legal mechanisms can be expected to have an impact on the gender pay gap in a number of ways." (Discussion, page 105)
Example:

This research impacts the policy domain by providing evidence-based insights that can influence labor laws and wage policies at the national and international levels.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The study discusses both immediate and long-term impacts. For example, changes in wage policies can have immediate effects on gender pay inequality, while other changes (such as promoting inclusive labor markets) can have enduring effects over time.
"The effectiveness of anti-discrimination legislation is dependent on the willingness and ability of individual litigants to bring actions." (Results, page 99)
Example:

Short-term Impact: Recommendations on wage audits and transparency measures can quickly affect employer practices.
Long-term Impact: The broader push for structural reforms in pay equality could take years to fully manifest in reduced gender pay gaps globally.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The key stakeholders identified include policymakers, trade unions, employers, researchers, and international organizations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO).
"This report was commissioned by the Gender, Equality and Diversity Branch (GED) of the ILO in Geneva." (Preface, page iii)
Example:

Policymakers will use the research to inform decisions on labor laws.
Employers will benefit from guidelines on how to conduct gender audits and close pay gaps within their organizations.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research has a broad impact across several sectors, including labor market policy, social dialogue, and legal mechanisms.
"Conditions conducive to gender equal, inclusive and transparent labor markets can be characterized as requiring: i) high coverage of employment standards and ii) supportive wage practices." (Executive Summary, page ix)
Example:

Broad Impact: The findings could influence policies across different regions and sectors, from industrial labor practices to public sector employment regulations.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The policy recommendations provided in the research can be adapted to various national contexts, making the findings scalable.
"This paper aspires to review key issues, policy mechanisms and international evidence with respect to closing the gender pay gap." (Preface, page iii)
Example:

The study’s guidelines on wage audits and transparency can be implemented by both public and private sectors globally, demonstrating high transferability across different labor markets.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research identifies innovative policy mechanisms, such as using social dialogue to close gender pay gaps, that could disrupt current wage practices.
"Social dialogue and collective bargaining are most likely to promote inclusive and gender equal employment systems." (Discussion, page 37)
Example:

Introducing mandatory wage audits could disrupt traditional compensation structures, compelling organizations to evaluate their internal pay practices for gender disparities.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

Ethical considerations are at the core of this research, as it promotes gender equality, fair wages, and inclusive labor markets.
"Strengthening and extending employment standards, through higher minimum wages, more equal rights for non-standard workers..." (Conclusion, page 108)
Example:

The emphasis on fair pay and non-discriminatory practices supports long-term sustainability in wage equity policies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

The research includes practical tools for implementation, such as wage audit guidelines and recommendations for strengthening legal enforcement mechanisms.
"To promote inclusive and transparent labor markets to close the gender pay gap employment standards need strengthening..." (Conclusion, page xii)
Example:

Usability: The research can be directly applied by organizations and governments to implement more transparent wage-setting processes.
9. Cross-Disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The study pulls from multiple disciplines, including law, economics, and sociology, and addresses global issues such as wage inequality in various countries.
"International legal mechanisms and national measures are essential in creating gender-equal and inclusive labor markets." (Discussion, page 22)
Example:

Cross-disciplinary impact: The research’s legal, economic, and social policy implications make it relevant across various fields.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

The research promotes adaptable solutions to changing labor markets, such as flexible wage-setting mechanisms and collective bargaining agreements that can evolve over time.
"New initiatives and new thinking are needed." (Discussion, page 37)
Example:

The study’s approach to using collective bargaining to close gender pay gaps demonstrates its resilience, as such mechanisms can be adapted to suit different economic conditions.
This analysis reflects how the research contributes to various dimensions of impact, providing valuable insights for different stakeholders and offering scalable solutions to a global issue.
