Based on the research impact framework and the content from the study titled "Social Dialogue and Economic Performance: What Matters for Business" authored by Damian Grimshaw, Aristea Koukiadaki, and Isabel Tavora (ILO, 2017), I will now evaluate the study across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact. This analysis will map the findings and provide excerpts and examples where relevant.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The report provides a state-of-the-art review of academic research as well as a snapshot of real-world views of members of the international business community drawing on original interview data with Global Deal signatory parties and other stakeholders." (Introduction, p.1)
"Social dialogue contributes to stabilizing industrial relations and supports productivity growth, preserving firm-specific knowledge, and ensuring sustainable business responses." (Conclusion, p. 55)
Example: The study impacts multiple domains:

Economic Domain: It assesses how social dialogue supports business growth, with evidence from firm-level, sector, and national contexts, influencing economic policies related to productivity and stability.
Policy Domain: The findings may influence public policies aimed at promoting inclusive growth and decent work, aligning with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Effective social dialogue is positively associated with a range of positive outcomes for businesses, with long-term implications for business development and economic stability." (Conclusion, p. 55)
Example: The report's long-term impact lies in its potential to shape both policy and business practices on social dialogue, particularly in developing economies. In the short term, it influences firm-level strategies for managing labor relations and productivity.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The present report provides a snapshot of real-world views of the international business community, drawing on interviews with Global Deal signatories and other stakeholders." (Introduction, p. 1)
Example:

Direct Stakeholders: Policymakers, labor unions, business leaders, and international organizations like the ILO and OECD benefit from this research as they use its insights to promote social dialogue frameworks.
Indirect Stakeholders: Employees in various industries, particularly in countries with developing social dialogue mechanisms, benefit from improved labor relations and business practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"The report includes a detailed analysis at the enterprise, sectoral, national, and inter-firm levels, highlighting the varied effects of social dialogue." (p. 1)
Example: The deep impact of the study is evident in its detailed evaluation of social dialogue at multiple levels (firm, sector, and national). The broad impact spans economic and policy frameworks globally, informing efforts to promote stable labor relations and economic performance.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"Social dialogue can play a key role in supporting business growth in both developed and developing economies, highlighting its transferability across contexts." (Conclusion, p. 56)
Example: The findings on social dialogue can be scaled to influence both large-scale multinational enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, they are transferable across different economic contexts, making the report relevant globally.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"The report points to areas where further research is needed, including the role of social dialogue in developing economies and supply chains." (Conclusion, p. 56)
Example: By examining the interaction between social dialogue and inter-firm contracting in global supply chains, the study opens opportunities for innovative business practices that improve productivity and reduce industrial conflict, potentially disrupting current practices in labor relations.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"The Global Deal is guided by the notion that social dialogue is the best instrument to sustain long-term benefits for workers, business, and society." (p. 1)
Example: The study promotes ethical labor practices by emphasizing inclusive growth and decent work, aligned with the SDGs. It highlights how social dialogue contributes to sustainable economic development.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Social dialogue contributes to stabilizing industrial relations, supporting productivity growth, and preserving firm-specific knowledge." (p. 55)
Example: The findings are highly implementable for both policymakers and business leaders looking to integrate social dialogue into business strategies, making it usable for workplace conflict management and productivity improvements.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Social dialogue is positively associated with a range of positive outcomes for businesses, including stable industrial relations and productivity growth." (p. 55)
Example: The study’s cross-disciplinary relevance spans economics, labor studies, and public policy. It is also globally relevant, as it addresses social dialogue's role in both developed and developing countries.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"Social dialogue is a governance mechanism that can adapt to varying business and political contexts, ensuring its relevance across different countries." (p. 9)
Example: The research highlights how social dialogue mechanisms can adapt to economic changes, making businesses more resilient during crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis.

This detailed assessment of the dimensions of research impact aligns with the study's broader contributions to labor relations, economic development, and social dialogue.
