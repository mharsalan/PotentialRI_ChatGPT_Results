Based on the content reviewed from both files, here is a detailed assessment of the research study's impact along the 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The research assesses how austerity measures influenced collective bargaining and wage settings across seven European countries (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain), impacting the manufacturing sector, particularly the business systems in those regions.
Page Reference: Introduction, page 2 of the attached study.
Example: This research primarily impacts the economic and social domains, as it provides insights into wage dynamics, labor market regulations, and the roles of unions and employers. It may also influence policy-making by informing policymakers on the effects of supranational interventions in labor laws​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The study evaluates both the short-term effects of austerity measures on wage reductions and bargaining systems, and the potential long-term erosion of multi-employer bargaining.
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 7 of the attached study.
Example: Short-term impacts include the immediate wage cuts and decentralized wage-setting systems, while long-term impacts concern the weakening of industrial relations and labor market regulations over time, especially in countries like Greece and Romania​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The research involves key stakeholders, including national governments, trade unions, employer federations, and workers in the manufacturing sector.
Page Reference: Methodology, page 4 of the study.
Example: Direct stakeholders are trade unions and employers, who are actively involved in collective bargaining processes, while indirect stakeholders include government bodies that regulate labor policies and the broader public who are affected by wage adjustments and employment stability​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research offers deep insights into specific countries' labor systems while providing a broad, cross-country comparative analysis of how collective bargaining and wage settings have evolved post-crisis.
Page Reference: Comparative Analysis, page 6.
Example: This study has deep impact by critically analyzing the changes within specific national labor systems, like Greece and Romania, and broad impact through its comparison of seven European countries, influencing future research and policy development across different sectors​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The findings from manufacturing sectors in crisis-hit European countries could inform labor policies and practices in other industries and regions.
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 7.
Example: The study has transferability in applying lessons learned from collective bargaining reforms to other sectors or countries facing economic downturns. It could also be scaled to analyze similar effects in service sectors or other regions beyond Europe​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: The study highlights the disruptive potential of supranational institutions in altering traditional labor market frameworks.
Page Reference: Page 5.
Example: Disruptive in nature, the research shows how European governance measures fundamentally shifted national collective bargaining practices, challenging existing paradigms in labor negotiations and union power, especially in countries like Greece and Portugal .
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The study discusses the long-term sustainability of labor market systems and addresses the ethical implications of wage reductions and their broader societal effects.
Page Reference: Page 7.
Example: The research raises concerns about the ethical impact of austerity measures on worker rights, suggesting that such policies exacerbate income inequality and create an unsustainable labor environment, especially in low-wage countries like Romania .
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The research offers practical insights for policymakers and labor organizations on how to adapt bargaining systems post-crisis.
Page Reference: Conclusion, page 7.
Example: The study's findings on collective bargaining's usability can help inform governments and labor unions about which policies best protect workers during economic downturns, particularly in maintaining fair wage structures and avoiding labor market fragmentation .
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: This research is relevant beyond labor studies, influencing fields like political science, economics, and social policy.
Page Reference: Comparative Analysis, page 6.
Example: The cross-country analysis is globally relevant and could help inform international bodies like the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the European Commission about labor regulation practices that mitigate social and economic fallout during global financial crises​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The research shows how different countries' labor markets adapted to crisis, with some systems showing resilience through stronger institutional frameworks.
Page Reference: Comparative Analysis, page 6.
Example: Countries like Italy and Slovenia showed resilience by retaining multi-employer bargaining systems, while others like Greece and Romania were less adaptable and experienced significant fragmentation of collective bargaining structures (Knowledge - Potential R…).
