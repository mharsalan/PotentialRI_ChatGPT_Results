I have extracted information from both the document you uploaded and the relevant impact dimensions provided. Below is a detailed analysis of the research impact dimensions for the report titled "Report on collective dismissals: A comparative and contextual analysis of the law on collective redundancies in 13 European countries":

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The report focuses on the comparative legal analysis of collective dismissals in 13 European countries, highlighting different regulatory frameworks and the role of public authorities in the collective redundancy process (Introduction, p.19).
It emphasizes both the socio-economic impacts of collective dismissals and the involvement of supranational organizations like the EU and ILO in shaping these regulations (Introduction, p.17).
Example:
This research impacts multiple domains:

Policy Domain: The findings can inform national and EU labor policies, particularly regarding collective dismissals and workforce management during restructuring.
Legal Domain: It influences legislative practices by comparing and suggesting harmonization of dismissal laws across the EU, potentially affecting future labor law reforms in member states.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The report's findings, especially regarding the legal framework on collective dismissals, have both immediate implications for current restructuring processes and long-term effects on labor law development (Conclusions, p.118).
Example:
Short-term Impact: The immediate effect would be the potential adjustment of national labor laws in response to the recommendations in the report.
Long-term Impact: The report provides foundational insights for future studies on labor market reforms, creating a long-lasting influence on EU labor laws and regulations, possibly setting a standard for collective dismissal procedures.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:
The primary stakeholders identified include government bodies, labor unions, employers, and EU policy makers, all of whom play roles in the collective dismissal process and in implementing policy recommendations (Introduction, p.17).
Example:
Direct Stakeholders: Government policymakers who use the report to guide labor reforms, and labor unions that utilize the findings to protect worker rights.
Indirect Stakeholders: Workers and the general public, who benefit from more secure and fair dismissal processes as a result of the report's influence on policy.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:
The study deeply impacts the field of labor law, particularly by contributing new legal interpretations of EU Directives related to collective redundancies (EU Directive 1998/59, p.38).
Its breadth spans multiple countries and sectors, addressing both national and supranational legal frameworks (Introduction, p.21).
Example:
Deep Impact: It deeply influences labor law scholars and policymakers by offering in-depth analysis and recommendations on collective dismissal laws across 13 EU countries.
Broad Impact: The report's broad scope, encompassing national differences and supranational regulations, means it influences various sectors such as government policy, legal practice, and social welfare systems.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:
The studyâ€™s comparative framework allows for scalability, as the recommendations can be adapted and implemented in different EU countries facing similar labor market challenges (Conclusions, p.116).
Example:
The legal principles identified in the report can be applied to other countries beyond the EU, especially those undergoing economic restructuring and seeking to harmonize dismissal laws with international standards.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:
The report introduces new perspectives on the role of public authorities in regulating dismissals, suggesting a more proactive involvement in the consultation and decision-making process (Section 5.7, p.111).
Example:
This approach could disrupt traditional labor market regulation by encouraging early public intervention in the redundancy process, preventing large-scale job losses and enhancing worker protection.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:
The report addresses the ethical dimension of protecting workers' rights during dismissals, suggesting that legal frameworks should focus on both economic efficiency and social justice (Section 5, p.97).
Example:
It promotes sustainable employment practices by advocating for regulations that balance the needs of employers with the welfare of workers, reducing long-term social and economic inequality.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:
The report provides practical legal recommendations that can be readily implemented by national governments and EU institutions to improve collective dismissal procedures (Conclusions, p.118).
Example:
Policymakers can directly apply the report's findings to revise existing laws on collective dismissals, ensuring better consultation processes and fairer compensation for affected workers.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:
The study is relevant to multiple fields, including labor law, economics, and social policy. It also has global relevance as many non-EU countries face similar challenges with collective dismissals during economic downturns (Introduction, p.19).
Example:
Labor law experts, economists, and policymakers in various regions can use the findings to develop or reform their collective redundancy laws, ensuring cross-disciplinary collaboration between legal, economic, and social sectors.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:
The report suggests that flexible legal frameworks for collective dismissals are crucial for maintaining economic resilience during crises, such as the post-2008 financial downturn (Section 2, p.21).
Example:
By recommending adaptable labor laws that allow for quick responses to economic shifts, the research helps create more resilient economies that can better manage unemployment during restructuring.
This comprehensive analysis highlights how the research impacts various dimensions of society, law, and policy, offering both immediate and long-term benefits. If you need further information or deeper insights into any specific section, feel free to ask!
