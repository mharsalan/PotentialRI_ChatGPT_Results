Based on the detailed study of the attached research paper and aligning it with various potential research impacts discussed in the available resources, here is an organized list of potential research impacts related to the study, categorized by the types of impacts:

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: The study contributes to academic discussions around the impact of austerity measures on collective bargaining and wage-setting systems, especially in Southern and Eastern European countries. It adds empirical data and comparative analysis across seven countries, deepening our understanding of labor market transformations in times of economic crisis​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Theoretical Impact: The study offers theoretical insights into the relationship between supranational economic policies (e.g., EU interventions) and national labor market outcomes, helping refine theories of institutional change, labor market regulation, and economic governance​(impact pathway).
2. Economic Impact
Policy Influence and Economic Reform: The findings could directly influence labor market policies by showing how certain austerity-driven reforms weakened collective bargaining systems and shifted wage-setting practices. This could impact future economic policies aimed at fostering labor market stability and wage equity in similar crisis-hit economies​(Research impact toolkit).
Long-term Economic Benefits: By proposing potential reforms and showcasing how different labor models reacted to external shocks, the study has implications for improving wage structures, which could enhance productivity and worker satisfaction, leading to long-term economic growth​(Research Impact Knowled…).
3. Policy and Governance Impact
Policy Change: The study can influence labor and social policy at national and EU levels by offering evidence-based critiques of austerity measures' impact on collective bargaining. Policymakers could utilize these insights to avoid similar pitfalls in future economic crises​(impact pathway).
Governance and Institutional Reform: The study highlights the need for stronger institutional frameworks to protect labor rights during economic downturns. These findings can guide future reforms to safeguard collective bargaining structures​(Common Research Impact …).
4. Social and Cultural Impact
Labor Rights and Worker Empowerment: The study contributes to the broader discourse on labor rights and the social impact of economic austerity. It can empower trade unions and civil society organizations by providing them with data and analysis to advocate for stronger collective bargaining rights​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Social Justice and Equity: By highlighting the inequitable impacts of austerity on lower-income workers and vulnerable labor markets, the research promotes social justice and the importance of maintaining equitable labor systems, even during times of crisis​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
5. Stakeholder Impact
Impact on Trade Unions and Employers: The study's findings can directly influence stakeholders like trade unions, which could use the research to strengthen their arguments for more robust collective bargaining mechanisms and wage protection systems. Employers could also benefit from insights on stable wage-setting mechanisms that avoid the volatility of crisis-driven adjustments​(Research impact toolkit).
Public Awareness and Debate: The research can contribute to public debates about the role of labor unions and the importance of fair wages in post-crisis economies, potentially shifting public opinion toward more favorable views on collective bargaining​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Technological and Methodological Impact
Data and Comparative Methods: The research employs comparative data analysis across seven countries, providing a methodological framework that can be applied to other cross-national studies. This methodological approach could be used in future research analyzing labor market reforms in other global regions​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Environmental Impact
Indirect Environmental Sustainability: While not the primary focus, stronger labor markets and fair wage policies could indirectly contribute to more sustainable economic models. A stable workforce and fair labor conditions can lead to more sustainable business practices and, ultimately, environmental sustainability through responsible economic governance​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Global and Cross-disciplinary Relevance
Global Policy Relevance: Although focused on European countries, the study's insights into labor market responses to austerity could be relevant to global economic governance, particularly in developing countries facing similar external economic pressures. International bodies like the International Labour Organization (ILO) or the European Commission might leverage the study to inform global labor policy​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Cross-disciplinary Applications: The study's findings can be applied across various fields such as economics, labor studies, political science, and sociology. Its relevance extends to disciplines concerned with public policy, institutional resilience, and labor economics​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Resilience and Adaptability
Labor Market Resilience: The study sheds light on the adaptability (or lack thereof) of labor market institutions during economic shocks. Its findings on resilience strategies—such as stronger institutional protections for collective bargaining in countries like Slovenia—offer practical lessons for enhancing labor market adaptability in other regions​(Research Impact Knowled…).
10. Ethical and Sustainability Impact
Sustainability of Labor Systems: The research contributes to discussions about the long-term sustainability of labor markets and collective bargaining structures, advocating for policies that balance economic austerity with the need for fair wages and labor rights​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
Ethical Implications: The study highlights the ethical concerns surrounding wage reductions and the erosion of labor rights during economic crises, calling for a rethinking of policies that disproportionately affect low-income workers and exacerbate inequality​(Research Impact Knowled…).
By analyzing the study through these various dimensions, it is clear that the research has far-reaching implications across academic, economic, social, and policy domains. It contributes to global discussions about labor market stability, wage equity, and the role of institutions in protecting workers' rights during economic downturns.
