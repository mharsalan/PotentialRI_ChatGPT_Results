After thoroughly analyzing the provided study and aligning its content with common research impact dimensions, here is a detailed breakdown of potential research impacts specific to this study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
The study on collective dismissals has the potential to impact multiple societal and academic domains:

Policy Domain: This research can inform policy-makers and influence the creation or reform of labor laws related to collective redundancies, especially within the EU context. For example, it could impact legislation addressing the balance between employer flexibility and employee protection during economic downturns​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

Economic Domain: By evaluating collective dismissal regulations, the study can contribute to economic policy adjustments, ensuring that mass redundancies are handled in a way that minimizes economic instability and promotes fair compensation for employees​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

Legal Domain: This research provides a comparative analysis of collective dismissal regulations across Europe. This could lead to legal reforms at national and EU levels, promoting more harmonized labor laws​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

Social Domain: The study could influence public awareness and dialogue around the social impacts of collective redundancies, such as the implications for unemployment, workers' rights, and corporate responsibility​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

2. Duration of Research Impact
Short-term Impact: Immediate changes could include adjustments in corporate practices regarding redundancies and restructuring, as well as more robust legal frameworks in countries with weaker protections​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

Long-term Impact: The findings could have a lasting influence on how collective dismissals are regulated across Europe, potentially leading to more standardized labor protections and a stronger role for supranational organizations like the EU and ILO in shaping global labor policies​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research Impact Knowled…).

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
The study's findings impact several stakeholder groups:

Policy-makers: Government and EU labor policy-makers could use this study to revise or strengthen collective dismissal regulations​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

Employers and Unions: Employers may need to adapt their restructuring practices to comply with new or improved regulations, while unions could leverage the findings to advocate for stronger worker protections​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).

Workers: Directly affected by changes in collective dismissal processes, workers stand to benefit from improved protections and compensation following large-scale redundancies​(Common Research Impact …).

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Deep Impact: The study deeply influences the field of labor law by offering a nuanced legal analysis that can lead to substantial reforms in how collective redundancies are managed across different jurisdictions​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

Broad Impact: Its broad analysis across multiple EU nations means it can impact a wide array of fields including labor law, economics, social welfare, and corporate governance​(impact pathway).

5. Scalability and Transferability
Scalability: The legal frameworks discussed could be expanded to other European countries or adapted to address labor challenges in non-EU countries facing economic restructuring​(Common Research Impact …).

Transferability: The principles and recommendations can be applied across various industries, particularly those most affected by economic downturns, such as manufacturing, retail, and services​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Innovation: The study introduces innovative legal frameworks that propose a more active role for public authorities in the redundancy process, potentially setting new legal precedents in labor law​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Common Research Impact …).

Disruption: The recommendations could disrupt current corporate practices by requiring earlier and more comprehensive involvement of public authorities in managing large-scale dismissals​(impact pathway).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
The study emphasizes ethical labor practices, advocating for a balance between economic efficiency and social justice. By ensuring fair treatment for workers during restructuring, it contributes to the long-term sustainability of labor markets​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).

8. Implementation and Usability
