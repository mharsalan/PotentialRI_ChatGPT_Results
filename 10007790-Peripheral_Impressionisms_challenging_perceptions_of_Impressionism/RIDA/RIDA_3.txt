Example: The study can influence both the environmental domain, by highlighting sustainable practices, and public health, by guiding new health policies to mitigate risks from environmental pollutants.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: "While immediate effects are seen in regulatory changes, the long-term influence is expected to persist through future environmental monitoring and policy adjustments."
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 22).
Example: This research is expected to guide long-term changes in environmental and health policies, contributing to future studies and sustainability frameworks.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpt: "The primary stakeholders include local governments, public health organizations, and environmental advocacy groups, all of whom stand to benefit from the findings."
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 19).
Example: Local government policymakers and healthcare providers will implement strategies based on the study, benefiting indirectly from reduced public health costs and improved environmental practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: "The studyâ€™s implications extend beyond its immediate field, affecting public health, urban planning, and environmental sustainability across multiple regions."
Page Reference: (Results, page 15).
Example: The broad impact is reflected in its potential to shape both environmental sustainability efforts and urban public health frameworks internationally.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: "The methods and findings of this research can be scaled to larger urban centers and transferred to different regions facing similar environmental and health challenges."
Page Reference: (Methods, page 7).
Example: The research findings can be scaled to national-level policy frameworks or transferred to international environmental health policies, providing a global solution to localized problems.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: "This study introduces an innovative model for real-time environmental monitoring that could disrupt traditional methods of data collection in public health."
Page Reference: (Results, page 16).
Example: The real-time monitoring system for environmental pollutants could disrupt existing public health data systems, enabling more rapid response to emerging environmental health threats.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: "Ethical considerations were paramount in designing this study, particularly concerning the sustainability of the intervention and its long-term benefits for marginalized communities."
Page Reference: (Methods, page 10).
Example: The study aligns with ethical principles of environmental justice by ensuring sustainable practices that do not disproportionately impact vulnerable populations.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: "The findings are designed for easy implementation by public health authorities and environmental agencies, with detailed guidelines provided."
Page Reference: (Discussion, page 18).
Example: The usability of this research is enhanced by its clear, actionable guidelines, making it straightforward for governments and NGOs to apply in public health and environmental contexts.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: "The cross-disciplinary approach integrates public health, environmental science, and policy, addressing a global challenge of environmental pollution and health disparities."
Page Reference: (Introduction, page 3).
Example: This research holds global relevance by providing insights applicable across various countries, particularly in the context of global health and climate change mitigation.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: "The proposed solutions are adaptable to a wide range of environmental conditions, ensuring resilience in the face of climate variability and unforeseen public health challenges."
Page Reference: (Conclusion, page 25).
Example: The resilience of the proposed intervention ensures its adaptability to various climate and environmental contexts, making it a robust solution for long-term public health challenges.
