Domains of Research Impact:

Excerpts: The study has multidisciplinary influence across various domains such as environmental, health, and education. For instance, research on biodiversity conservation has practical implications for policies on climate change and environmental management (Results, pg. 35).
Example: The study impacts the environmental domain by promoting sustainable land use strategies. It also influences the policy domain by providing scientific data that informs public health initiatives related to biodiversity conservation.
Duration of Research Impact:

Excerpts: The research contributes both to immediate environmental management and long-term policy changes, especially in land conservation and climate action strategies (Discussion, pg. 47).
Example: In the short term, the research informs immediate biodiversity conservation actions, while long-term impacts include shaping policies for sustainable land management.
Stakeholders of Research Impact:

Excerpts: Stakeholders include policymakers, conservationists, and local communities who directly benefit from the findings related to biodiversity and land management (Discussion, pg. 50).
Example: Policymakers benefit from the research by using it to develop sustainable development frameworks, while local communities benefit from improved environmental conditions.
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: The study provides deep insights into biodiversity conservation strategies, particularly focusing on land use and ecosystem preservation (Results, pg. 40).
Example: The research deeply impacts the conservation efforts of endangered species, with broader implications for global biodiversity.
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: The study's recommendations for biodiversity conservation can be scaled from local conservation projects to national and international climate change mitigation efforts (Methods, pg. 20).
Example: Conservation techniques from the research can be transferred to other countries, contributing to global environmental sustainability efforts.
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: The research introduces innovative methodologies for evaluating biodiversity using advanced remote sensing technology (Methods, pg. 28).
Example: It disrupts traditional conservation approaches by integrating cutting-edge technology like satellite monitoring for more accurate biodiversity assessments.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
