Detailed Assessment of Research Impact Dimensions
Based on the study and predefined instructions, here’s a detailed breakdown of how the research aligns with each of the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts:

"Research focuses on art history through the lens of Impressionism, particularly peripheral figures, collectors, and socio-historical changes." (Results, Page 72)
"It brings into focus how certain Impressionists and their collectors influenced economic shifts and art markets in the late 19th and early 20th centuries." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

The research impacts the Academic and Cultural Domain by contributing to new perspectives in art history and re-evaluating lesser-known Impressionists and their socio-economic contributions.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"The socio-historical approach adopted by scholars such as T.J. Clark has had a lasting impact on how Impressionism is viewed today." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Long-term Impact: This research will likely influence art history for years, by shaping the discourse around Impressionism and art market studies, offering foundational knowledge for future scholars to re-evaluate art collections and cultural trends in Europe.
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

"Collectors like Samuel Courtauld, guided by Fry, are part of the economic and social art history narrative." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Stakeholders include art historians, museum curators, collectors, and academic institutions involved in re-evaluating art market economics. Additionally, cultural institutions benefit as they can incorporate these findings into exhibitions and educational materials.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

"It discusses Impressionists who were 'written out' of art history, revealing broader economic and social implications of their exclusion." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Broad Impact: This research extends beyond art history to the economic and cultural sectors, influencing fields such as socio-economic history, market economics, and museum curation.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

"The rise of market studies as an emerging discipline in art history highlights its interdisciplinary nature, blending economics and art." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Transferability: Insights from the study could be applied to other art markets globally, especially in understanding how economic shifts influence the valuation of art and historical legacies, making it highly transferable to international cultural economies.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

"A shift towards market studies represents a potential new direction for understanding Impressionism's impact." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Disruption Potential: This study disrupts traditional art historical narratives, advocating for economic-based analyses of art, challenging established notions of connoisseurship and the purely formalist approach to Impressionism.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

"Art market studies, while interdisciplinary, face suspicion due to the blending of economic and historical analysis." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Ethical Considerations: The study raises questions about how art history narratives are constructed, shedding light on the inclusion of marginalized figures, ensuring a fairer representation of artists who contributed to the economic landscape but were previously overlooked.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

"Research can invigorate the field of museum curation, offering new insights into how collections are formed and maintained." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Usability: The findings could be implemented in museums and art institutions, guiding curators on how to build more inclusive exhibitions and present economic influences on the formation of art collections.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

"Art market studies introduce economic considerations into art history, which could be applied in other global contexts." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Global Relevance: The study's implications for the art market are globally applicable, particularly in regions where colonial and post-colonial legacies shape art collection practices. This interdisciplinary approach makes it relevant to international art markets and global historical studies.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

"The formalist approach is still relevant, but socio-historical narratives continue to evolve, indicating the resilience of both perspectives." (Discussion, Page 72)
Example:

Resilience: The study shows how both formalist and socio-historical perspectives in art history have adapted over time, remaining relevant as new economic data and social history narratives are incorporated into museum practices and art market studies.
This structured approach outlines the research’s influence across various dimensions of impact, demonstrating its significance within academic, cultural, and socio-economic contexts.
