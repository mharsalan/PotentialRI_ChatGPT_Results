Potential Research Impacts for the Study
After reviewing the study and aligning it with the knowledge from research impact dimensions and the study content, I can organize the Potential Research Impacts into various categories:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Art History: This study deepens the academic understanding of Impressionism by focusing on peripheral figures, collectors, and the socio-economic history surrounding the movement. It challenges traditional art history narratives by including marginalized contributors.
New Methodological Approach: The socio-historical analysis used in this study sets a precedent for future research in art history, blending economic history with artistic movements, which may inspire cross-disciplinary studies between art, history, and economics.
Academic Discourse: This work introduces new discussions on the intersection of art markets and social change, potentially influencing future academic curricula, seminars, and conferences in fields like art history, cultural studies, and economic history.
2. Cultural and Social Impact
Cultural Understanding: By reevaluating lesser-known Impressionists and their relationships with collectors, the study enhances the public’s understanding of cultural heritage and art history. It may influence museum curation practices by highlighting overlooked artists and economic factors in the art world.
Public Engagement: This research can lead to public engagement efforts through museum exhibitions and cultural programs. Museums and galleries could use the findings to create new exhibitions that broaden public knowledge of Impressionism, emphasizing its socio-economic context.
3. Economic and Market Impact
Art Market Analysis: The study’s focus on the economic aspects of Impressionism, particularly the role of collectors and art market dynamics, can influence how art institutions, galleries, and auction houses approach the valuation of artwork, leading to new strategies in the art market.
Influence on Collectors and Institutions: The insights into how Impressionist art was marketed and collected could change how modern-day collectors view investment in art, possibly leading to shifts in contemporary art markets and investment trends.
Financial Impact on Museums: By offering a richer understanding of art collection histories, the study could help museums better attract funding, donors, and investors interested in supporting exhibitions that reflect a broader, more inclusive narrative of art history.
4. Educational Impact
Curriculum Development: The study could influence art history courses, leading to the inclusion of topics such as the economic forces behind art movements and the role of peripheral figures in shaping art trends. Universities may adopt these insights into their art history or cultural studies programs.
Student Training and Capacity Building: As this research brings an innovative approach to understanding Impressionism through economic history, it offers new material for student research projects, seminars, and academic discussions, helping train the next generation of scholars in interdisciplinary analysis.
5. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Policy in Arts and Culture: The study’s findings may influence cultural policy, especially regarding funding for museums and the preservation of marginalized art histories. Policies might be developed to promote the preservation and showcasing of lesser-known artists within major cultural institutions.
Art Market Regulation: With its focus on economic transactions within the art world, the research could inform discussions on policy regarding the regulation of art markets, particularly concerning provenance, authenticity, and the role of collectors.
6. Technological and Commercial Impact
Technological Tools in Art Curation: The study could inspire the development of new technological tools for cataloging and analyzing art collections, especially with respect to understanding the socio-economic backgrounds of artworks. This could lead to innovations in museum curation and digital platforms for art history education.
7. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Sustainable Practices in Art Preservation: By influencing the way museums curate and manage collections, the study could also lead to more sustainable practices in art preservation, focusing on less resource-intensive approaches to maintaining and showcasing artwork.
8. Global and Cross-disciplinary Relevance
Interdisciplinary Research: This study sits at the intersection of art history, economics, and social sciences, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration that could lead to new research methodologies and insights applicable beyond art history, such as in economic history or cultural economics.
Global Art Market: While the study focuses on European Impressionism, its approach to understanding the relationship between art and market forces could be applied to global art markets, influencing how cultural and artistic legacies are understood in different parts of the world.
9. Cultural Preservation and Heritage
Preservation of Marginalized Narratives: By highlighting the contributions of lesser-known Impressionists and the role of collectors, the research supports the preservation of marginalized narratives in cultural history, contributing to a more inclusive understanding of art’s development.
Heritage and Legacy Projects: This study could inspire heritage projects aimed at reviving interest in overlooked artists, contributing to the preservation of their work and legacy in public consciousness and museum collections.
10. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Public Awareness: Through potential exhibitions or public talks derived from this research, awareness about the socio-economic context of Impressionism can be raised, which could challenge and enrich public perceptions of art history.
Media Engagement: The findings may be featured in media outlets, both academic and popular, increasing public knowledge and interest in the role of economics in shaping art history, leading to a more informed and engaged audience.
These impacts reflect the study’s broad relevance and its ability to engage with various sectors, including academic institutions, cultural organizations, and the art market, while also contributing to public awareness and policy discussions.
