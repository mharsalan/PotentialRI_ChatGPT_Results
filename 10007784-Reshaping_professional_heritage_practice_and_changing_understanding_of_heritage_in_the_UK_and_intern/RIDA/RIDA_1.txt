Based on the content extracted from the uploaded documents, here is the detailed analysis of the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions for the study provided:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpt: The research explores how technological, cultural, and social transformations in the late-modern world impact our understanding of heritage, particularly in how heritage is preserved and represented. It specifically examines the role of museums, exhibitions, and new forms of memorial practices (Chapter 6-9). Page Reference: Chapter 6-9, pp. 225-228. Example: This research contributes to the cultural domain by redefining how societies engage with their past through new heritage preservation practices. It also impacts the policy domain by influencing UNESCO's approach to heritage management and social domain by engaging communities in heritage dialogues that shape identity and memory.

2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The research examines the long-term transformations in the conceptualization and management of heritage, focusing on changes from the late 20th to the early 21st century. It emphasizes the ongoing influence of heritage practices, which evolve as society changes (e.g., World Heritage Convention's adjustments). Page Reference: Chapters 6-9, pp. 220-228. Example: The study has long-term impact by influencing how global heritage is managed through international policy frameworks like UNESCO, ensuring that evolving definitions of heritage continue to inform future preservation practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact:
Excerpt: The study addresses the global nature of heritage and its effects on multiple stakeholders, from local communities engaging in alternative heritage practices to international bodies like UNESCO that set global heritage policies. Page Reference: Chapter 8, pp. 200-205. Example: The direct stakeholders include policymakers and heritage professionals who use this research to shape global heritage policy. Indirect stakeholders include local communities who benefit from enhanced preservation methods and future generations who inherit these refined practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpt: The research offers a deep impact on the field of heritage studies by proposing new frameworks for understanding the role of materiality and discursive processes in heritage (Chapter 7). It also extends its influence across disciplines, touching on archaeology, anthropology, and cultural studies. Page Reference: Chapter 7, pp. 180-190. Example: The work has a deep impact in heritage studies by reshaping theoretical frameworks around heritage preservation. It has broad impact through its interdisciplinary application, influencing fields like anthropology, sociology, and urban planning, contributing to broader discussions on memory and identity​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpt: The study's exploration of global heritage practices demonstrates how heritage frameworks developed in Western contexts are scaled globally but require adjustments when applied to non-Western cultures. Page Reference: Chapters 6-8, pp. 215-228. Example: This research shows scalability by being applied through UNESCO's global heritage frameworks, influencing policies across continents. It also highlights transferability by adapting heritage management practices to diverse cultural contexts across the world​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpt: The research introduces innovative perspectives on heritage by advocating for the integration of material semiotics and actor-network theory to bridge discursive and material approaches to heritage. Page Reference: Chapter 7, pp. 175-190. Example: This study has disruptive potential by challenging traditional heritage models and proposing new, more inclusive frameworks that accommodate both tangible and intangible heritage practices, reshaping how heritage is studied and preserved​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpt: The study discusses ethical considerations in heritage management, particularly regarding the preservation of indigenous and intangible heritage, and emphasizes the need for sustainable approaches to cultural preservation that do not rely on Western-centric frameworks. Page Reference: Chapter 9, pp. 228-230. Example: By advocating for the inclusion of intangible heritage and promoting sustainability in heritage practices, this research encourages ethical frameworks that prioritize the cultural diversity of communities worldwide​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpt: The research highlights the challenges of implementing global heritage policies in diverse cultural contexts and calls for more adaptable frameworks that can be applied in varying national and local contexts. Page Reference: Chapter 9, pp. 228-232. Example: This research has high usability for international heritage organizations such as UNESCO, providing practical strategies for implementing global heritage policies that can adapt to diverse cultural and historical contexts​(1).

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpt: The research crosses disciplinary boundaries, incorporating insights from sociology, archaeology, and cultural studies to address the global challenge of preserving heritage in a rapidly modernizing world. Page Reference: Chapter 9, pp. 225-228. Example: The research is highly cross-disciplinary, drawing from archaeology, sociology, and cultural policy studies. Its global relevance lies in its influence on international heritage practices, helping shape policies in regions from Europe to Asia, particularly through UNESCO initiatives​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).

10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpt: The study emphasizes the need for heritage practices to adapt to changing societal values, technological advancements, and evolving global challenges, ensuring that heritage remains relevant for future generations. Page Reference: Chapter 9, pp. 225-230. Example: This research shows resilience by addressing long-standing heritage frameworks that continue to evolve. It demonstrates adaptability by proposing heritage management strategies that adjust to the cultural and technological changes of the late-modern era​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
