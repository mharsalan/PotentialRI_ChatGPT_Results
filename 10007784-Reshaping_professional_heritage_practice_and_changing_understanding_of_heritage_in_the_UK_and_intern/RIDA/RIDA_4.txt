Based on the content of the research paper "Heritage Futures," here is a detailed breakdown of the research impact dimensions for the study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Heritage practices, broadly defined, contribute to the making of future worlds" (Preface, page xxix). The research explores "natural and cultural preservation" and how it intersects with heritage practices to produce various societal impacts .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: The research impacts cultural, environmental, and social domains by examining how heritage practices influence future sustainability and policy formulation. For instance, it looks at waste management as part of heritage conservation, expanding the dialogue beyond traditional preservation practices .
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The research explores conservation practices that aspire to preserve their collections for up to one million years" (Discussion and Conclusion, page 485). It emphasizes long-term impact by considering how present-day heritage practices affect future generations, up to the scale of "one million years" .
Page Reference: Discussion and Conclusion, page 485.
Example: Long-term impact is evident in projects like the Memory of Mankind initiative, which is designed to last for one million years. This establishes the research’s focus on enduring cultural legacies and sustainable conservation methods .
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The research involves collaboration with 25 international partner organizations" (Preface, page xxix). It identifies a range of stakeholders, including government bodies, intergovernmental organizations, museums, and conservationists .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: Stakeholders such as policymakers and museum professionals directly benefit from the research’s innovative approaches to conservation and the management of cultural and natural heritages .
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "Heritage practices create futures not only through conservation but through active decisions to discard, lose, or neglect certain elements" (Discussion and Conclusions, page 485). The research explores both deep impacts within conservation fields and broad impacts across other societal sectors .
Page Reference: Discussion and Conclusions, page 485.
Example: By examining the relationship between heritage and waste management, the research deeply impacts cultural preservation while broadening its influence to include environmental sustainability and policy .
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "The study takes a comparative approach across natural and cultural heritage practices" (Preface, page xxix). The research’s methods and findings are designed to be transferable across various fields, from conservation to global policymaking .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: The comparative nature of the research allows its findings to be scaled across different contexts, such as applying the conservation strategies from cultural heritage to biodiversity preservation .
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "By rethinking heritage practices, the research fosters innovation, encourages resilience, and promotes sustainability" (Preface, page xxix). This includes integrating waste management into heritage practices, challenging conventional methods .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: The integration of waste management into heritage studies presents a disruptive approach, as it challenges traditional heritage preservation by focusing on what is discarded and forgotten .
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The research attends to sustainability, both in terms of environmental practices and the future legacies of heritage management" (Discussion and Conclusion, page 485). It specifically highlights the ethical dimensions of conserving and managing heritage .
Page Reference: Discussion and Conclusion, page 485.
Example: The study incorporates sustainability by examining how present conservation actions can ensure future generations benefit from natural and cultural heritage, maintaining ethical practices in heritage management .
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The research collaborates with practitioners both inside and outside existing heritage preservation fields" (Preface, page xxix), ensuring that the findings can be practically applied by a range of stakeholders .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: By working closely with practitioners, the research ensures that its findings are directly usable in both policy development and practical heritage conservation efforts .
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The study spans natural and cultural heritage, drawing on anthropology, environmental science, and conservation practices" (Preface, page xxix). It engages with global concerns such as climate change and cultural loss .
Page Reference: Preface, page xxix.
Example: The research’s cross-disciplinary nature allows it to address global challenges, including cultural preservation in the context of environmental degradation .
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "The research emphasizes resilience in heritage practices, particularly in adapting to emerging societal and environmental challenges" (Discussion and Conclusion, page 485) .
Page Reference: Discussion and Conclusion, page 485.
Example: The adaptability of heritage practices, such as preserving cultural legacies while addressing environmental sustainability, ensures the continued relevance of the research in dynamic global contexts .
These dimensions outline how "Heritage Futures" contributes across various fields and domains, promoting innovation, sustainability, and long-term cultural impact.
