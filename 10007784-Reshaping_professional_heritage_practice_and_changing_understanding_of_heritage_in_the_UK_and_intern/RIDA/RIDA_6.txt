I will now proceed with the detailed analysis of the research paper based on the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" from the document you uploaded. The analysis will follow each dimension, providing relevant excerpts from the paper, examples of impact, and page references.

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: The paper covers a variety of research domains, such as environmental, social, policy, and cultural domains. For example, "The emergence of the Anthropocene from this perspective insists on something more than just ‘action’, as responses to climate change are commonly framed. Indeed, ‘action’ if tied to endless growth and progress in neoliberal terms is liable to result in even greater environmental degradation" (Introduction, p. 25).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 25.
Example: The research has broad impact across environmental and policy domains, as it critically analyzes how heritage and human actions intersect with climate change, pushing for rethinking global and local environmental strategies.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: The book anticipates both immediate and long-term impacts. For example, "The Anthropocene is both reflective and predictive, which is surely at the root of its take up across the arts and humanities in recent years" (Introduction, p. 25).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 25.
Example: The book discusses immediate awareness shifts in academia and cultural sectors, but also highlights how the theoretical contributions could shape future policy frameworks and cross-generational cultural memory, indicating long-term influence.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: The book identifies various direct and indirect stakeholders, including scholars, policymakers, environmental organizations, and the general public. It states, "The future is already deterritorializing...The chapters assembled here demonstrate the significant possibilities inherent in the arts, humanities and social sciences in collaboratively building alternative futures in, of and after the Anthropocene" (Preface, p. 17).
Page Reference: Preface, p. 17.
Example: Stakeholders include academics and researchers focused on environmental humanities, governmental policymakers, and cultural institutions aiming to integrate sustainability practices.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: The depth of the book's impact lies in its focus on theoretical shifts within heritage studies, while its breadth covers interdisciplinary and global concerns. It notes, "We see this also in the central conceit of naming the ‘Anthropos’ as a homogenous geological agent, a discursive gesture that effectively erases historical inequities and present injustices through the figure of a universal human agent" (Introduction, p. 29).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 29.
Example: Deep impact is achieved within heritage and environmental studies, while broad impact spans across global climate policy, cultural heritage preservation, and social justice debates.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: The research emphasizes scalability, particularly how its theoretical frameworks can be applied to different regions and contexts. "Across these domains, heritage can be seen to intersect with the issues raised by climate change and the Anthropocene in numerous ways" (Introduction, p. 24).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 24.
Example: The theories on heritage in the Anthropocene are transferable to other global issues, such as biodiversity conservation, indigenous land rights, and urban planning.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: The book challenges traditional heritage frameworks and presents innovative ideas about post-human futures, indicating its potential for disruption. "To help resituate this debate, Yusoff focuses on the human as fossil-to-come" (Introduction, p. 22).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 22.
Example: The book disrupts conventional notions of heritage management, urging for integration of non-human actors and ecological concerns, potentially transforming policy and academic discourses.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: Ethical considerations are deeply integrated, particularly regarding heritage conservation in the face of environmental collapse. "It is both reflective and predictive, which is surely at the root of its take up across the arts and humanities in recent years" (Introduction, p. 25).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 25.
Example: The research promotes sustainable heritage practices, ensuring that future conservation efforts are not only ethically sound but also aligned with broader environmental policies.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: The book outlines practical applications for heritage and policy-makers. For instance, "Historic sites around the world are at risk from rising sea levels and melting permafrost" (Introduction, p. 23).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 23.
Example: The research is highly usable for heritage practitioners working in climate-affected regions, as well as policy-makers developing new climate adaptation strategies for cultural sites.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: The cross-disciplinary nature of the research is evident as it combines insights from environmental science, cultural studies, anthropology, and more. "Heritage as we understand it in this volume is an intersubjective and inherently transdisciplinary space where ongoing concerns over climate breakdown" (Introduction, p. 28).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 28.
Example: The book's relevance spans multiple disciplines, including environmental science, heritage studies, anthropology, and global policy, offering significant insights for international climate initiatives and cultural preservation efforts.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: Resilience is a key theme, especially regarding how cultural heritage can adapt to changing environmental and social conditions. "How might alternative and marginalized concepts of nature and culture challenge familiar methods of preservation?" (Introduction, p. 27).
Page Reference: Introduction, p. 27.
Example: The research offers frameworks for heritage management that can adapt to environmental changes, ensuring the resilience of both cultural practices and natural heritage sites.
