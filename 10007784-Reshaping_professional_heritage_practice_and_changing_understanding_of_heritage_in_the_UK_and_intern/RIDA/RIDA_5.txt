To assess the research paper across the "Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact" based on the predefined framework, here’s a breakdown for each dimension:

Domains of Research Impact (RI):

Excerpts: The research focuses on the politics of cultural and natural heritage, particularly the impact of climate change on heritage conservation and how loss is viewed within these contexts (Page 3 - Results). It highlights the intersection of environmental conservation, cultural heritage, and sociopolitical decision-making.
Example: This research contributes to both the academic domain (heritage studies and environmental science) and the policy domain by influencing how conservation decisions are made in response to global climate challenges​(5).
Duration of RI:

Excerpts: The paper suggests that loss, in some cases, can generate new forms of value, implying a long-term shift in how heritage is managed (Page 7 - Discussion).
Example: The study's insights could influence heritage management strategies long-term, as communities and policymakers may begin to integrate the concept of “curated decay” as a viable management approach, especially under climate change pressures​(5) .
Stakeholder of RI:

Excerpts: The research impacts various stakeholders, including policymakers, conservationists, and community members affected by heritage loss (Page 5 - Methods).
Example: Policymakers are directly impacted, as the study calls for a reconsideration of current heritage preservation strategies. Indirectly, future generations benefit from policies that adapt to environmental changes while still valuing cultural heritage​(5) .
Depth and Breadth of Impact:

Excerpts: The research has both deep impact (changing heritage management practices) and broad relevance across cultural, environmental, and sociopolitical domains (Page 6 - Results).
Example: By addressing the politics of heritage loss, the research not only deeply impacts heritage studies but also broadly influences fields such as environmental policy and public administration, particularly in climate-vulnerable regions​(5)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Scalability and Transferability:

Excerpts: The research framework developed for understanding loss in heritage can be adapted to other contexts, particularly in regions facing rapid climate change (Page 5 - Methods).
Example: The concept of "relinquishment" could be applied to different global contexts, from low-lying islands to cultural heritage sites affected by urban expansion (Knowledge - Potential R…).
Innovation and Disruption Potential:

Excerpts: The paper presents the innovative idea of "relinquishment" as a proactive approach to heritage loss, potentially disrupting traditional heritage conservation models (Page 4 - Discussion).
Example: By promoting the concept that loss can be generative, the research disrupts existing paradigms that aim solely at preservation, instead suggesting new pathways for heritage management under changing environmental conditions​(5).
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:

Excerpts: The study discusses the ethical implications of conservation choices, particularly in the context of scarce resources for heritage preservation (Page 6 - Results).
Example: By emphasizing that not all heritage can or should be saved, the research addresses the ethical need to prioritize resources ethically and sustainably, focusing on communities that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts​(5) .
Implementation and Usability:

Excerpts: The research offers practical frameworks for policymakers to make informed decisions about heritage conservation under climate stress (Page 7 - Discussion).
Example: The study’s recommendations could be implemented in heritage management policies globally, particularly in regions facing imminent cultural and natural heritage loss due to rising sea levels​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:

Excerpts: The research engages with both environmental and cultural heritage sectors, integrating insights from policy, social sciences, and environmental studies (Page 4 - Discussion).
Example: Its findings are relevant globally, particularly in regions like Kiribati where climate change is already causing significant loss of cultural heritage​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
Resilience and Adaptability:

Excerpts: The concept of "curated decay" reflects an adaptable approach to heritage management, emphasizing resilience in the face of inevitable loss (Page 7 - Discussion).
Example: By encouraging policymakers to adapt rather than resist change, the research promotes resilience in heritage management strategies, particularly in areas where preservation is no longer feasible (5).
This assessment demonstrates the multi-dimensional impact of the research, offering broad relevance across academic, policy, and environmental domains.
