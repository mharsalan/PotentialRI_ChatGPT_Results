I have extracted and analyzed the key research impact dimensions from the provided document. Below is the detailed assessment, categorized by the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: The study examines heritage management across various domains, including cultural and natural heritage, nuclear waste disposal, biological diversity, and cosmology. It expands traditional understandings of heritage to include both human and non-human actors in shaping the future​(2)​(2).
Example: This research broadens the scope of heritage management beyond conventional categories (cultural and natural heritage) to include diverse fields such as biodiversity and waste management, influencing academic, environmental, and policy domains.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts: The study aims to explore how different models of heritage-making might inform one another, with a focus on long-term sustainability. By rethinking the dominant paradigms of conservation, the research emphasizes both short-term applications and long-term cultural shifts​(2).
Example: In the long-term, the study's contributions could reshape heritage management and sustainability practices, influencing future policy changes and cultural perceptions of conservation.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI):
Excerpts: Stakeholders include policymakers, government bodies, cultural heritage managers, environmentalists, and indigenous communities, each benefiting from the comparative heritage practices discussed in the research​(2)​(2).
Example: Policymakers could implement the sustainable practices derived from cross-domain heritage research, while indigenous communities benefit from conservation models that incorporate their traditional knowledge.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: The research has a deep impact within heritage studies by expanding the field to include interdisciplinary approaches. It has broad relevance across various fields, including cultural conservation, biological diversity, and environmental sustainability​(2)​(2).
Example: The research deeply influences heritage conservation practices, while its broad impact is seen in its application across multiple domains such as nuclear waste management and biodiversity.
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: The study explores the possibility of transferring heritage management models from one domain to another to develop more sustainable and innovative practices​(2).
Example: Heritage management models from cultural preservation could be scaled and transferred to biodiversity conservation, creating broader applications in environmental policies.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: The study introduces new ways of conceptualizing heritage that challenge the existing paradigms by emphasizing connectivity and the integration of non-human actors in heritage-making​(2)​(2).
Example: This innovation could disrupt traditional heritage management systems, introducing more flexible and dynamic models that integrate biological and ecological considerations into cultural heritage.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: The research emphasizes sustainability, focusing on long-term preservation and ethical considerations regarding the integration of natural and cultural heritage. The study also stresses the importance of ethical treatment of non-human entities in heritage processes​(2)​(2).
Example: The study promotes sustainable practices by integrating conservation efforts for both cultural and natural heritage, ensuring that both are preserved for future generations while addressing ethical concerns related to biodiversity.
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: By providing a comparative framework for heritage management practices, the study aims to develop practical solutions that can be applied across different heritage domains​(2).
Example: The research outcomes could be used by local governments and heritage institutions to enhance heritage conservation strategies, leading to more sustainable management practices globally.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: The research is cross-disciplinary, bringing together insights from anthropology, heritage studies, environmental science, and more. It also addresses globally relevant issues such as climate change and heritage preservation in diverse geographic regions​(2)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
Example: By bridging multiple disciplines, the study offers globally relevant strategies for managing heritage in the face of challenges like climate change, benefiting countries and communities worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: The research focuses on developing flexible and resilient heritage management strategies that can adapt to changing environments and societal needs​(2).
Example: By promoting adaptable heritage models, the study ensures that conservation efforts can withstand environmental changes and societal shifts, contributing to the long-term resilience of cultural and natural heritage sites.
This assessment provides a comprehensive understanding of the research's impact across various dimensions.
