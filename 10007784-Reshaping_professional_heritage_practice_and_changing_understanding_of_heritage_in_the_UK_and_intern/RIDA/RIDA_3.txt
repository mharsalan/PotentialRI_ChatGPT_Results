Based on the contents of the attached file and the assessment required for the research impact dimensions, here is a detailed breakdown:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "I intend to provide better answers to the questions of Who gets to vote? and How are votes counted?—essentially to recommend an alternative electoral system..." (Introduction, Page 3)
Page Reference: Introduction, Page 3
Example: The study influences both the policy domain by suggesting electoral reforms and the social domain through its focus on restoring trust in the democratic process by addressing disenfranchisement.

2. Duration of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The role of this paper, then, is as a sort of citizen’s primer to our electoral crisis...helping to rebuild the necessary trust and confidence in our fundamental political institutions." (Abstract, Page 5)
Page Reference: Abstract, Page 5
Example: This research contributes to long-term impact by laying the foundation for ongoing reforms in electoral systems, which could be referenced in future political science studies or reforms.

3. Stakeholder of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpt: "The recommendations could be applied to local councils and Congress, too. The idea is that legislators, at any level, are the folks with whom citizens are most likely to have any sort of interaction or correspondence." (Introduction, Page 4)
Page Reference: Introduction, Page 4
Example: The direct stakeholders are policymakers who could implement reforms, while the public and voters are the indirect beneficiaries as their participation in the democratic process improves.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpt: "By driving voters in an ever-changing, highly-strategic way toward certain outcomes, parties quickly become entrenched and, over time, institutionalized—accepted virtually without question." (Discussion, Page 12)
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 12
Example: The research has broad impact as it addresses political systems, touching on electoral fairness, voter representation, and party control, impacting political science and democratic governance studies globally.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpt: "New York City’s experiment with PR eighty years ago is a startling example of the efficacy of a PR system in providing for fairer representation." (Discussion, Page 60)
Page Reference: Discussion, Page 60
Example: The study demonstrates transferability, as it discusses proportional representation models that could be adapted in various political systems globally, including municipal, state, and national levels.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpt: "An alternative electoral system that would allow for fair and effective representation of more people, helping to rebuild the necessary trust and confidence in our fundamental political institutions." (Abstract, Page 5)
Page Reference: Abstract, Page 5
Example: The study proposes an innovative electoral system reform, challenging the status quo of winner-takes-all elections, which could disrupt traditional political power structures.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpt: "The system is the foundation of our system of government. Unless it works fairly and transparently, we all might as well pack our bags and go back to all the places our ancestors came from." (Introduction, Page 3)
Page Reference: Introduction, Page 3
Example: Ethical considerations are central to the paper’s argument for a fairer electoral system, ensuring that voters’ rights and representation are protected, contributing to sustainable democratic practices.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpt: "The recommendations could be applied to local councils and Congress, too... legislators, at any level, are the folks with whom citizens are most likely to have any sort of interaction or correspondence." (Introduction, Page 4)
Page Reference: Introduction, Page 4
Example: The study is highly usable as it offers specific legislative reforms that could be implemented at various levels of government, with practical guidelines for electoral reform.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpt: "This discussion and proposal is concerned only with legislative offices, specifically state legislatures and assemblies—since these are where much of the real policy work affecting the lives of average citizens is handled." (Introduction, Page 4)
Page Reference: Introduction, Page 4
Example: The research has global relevance, as its exploration of electoral systems and representation can be applied across different political contexts globally, influencing political science, sociology, and legal studies.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpt: "The political system we have now simply does not allow for that. Less obvious are exactly why this is so, and what can be done." (Abstract, Page 5)
Page Reference: Abstract, Page 5
Example: The study’s proposals for electoral reform are aimed at creating a resilient system that can adapt to changing political environments and evolving voter expectations, ensuring long-term democratic stability.
