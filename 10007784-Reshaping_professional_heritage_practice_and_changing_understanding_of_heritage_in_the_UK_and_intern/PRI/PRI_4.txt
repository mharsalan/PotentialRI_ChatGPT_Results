Based on the entire study's text, several potential research impacts align with various dimensions, as per the available knowledge base and research impact dimensions. Here is an organized list of potential impacts:

1. Academic Impact
Advancement of Knowledge: The study contributes to a deeper understanding of heritage preservation, conservation practices, and their broader implications for cultural, environmental, and social sciences. It offers new methodologies for integrating concepts such as waste management into heritage discussions.
Cross-disciplinary Influence: The study crosses boundaries between anthropology, environmental science, and heritage studies. Its interdisciplinary approach enables future research in areas such as sustainability science, cultural conservation, and public policy​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Social and Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation and Heritage: This research directly contributes to the preservation of both natural and cultural heritage by offering insights into how conservation practices shape the future. This can inform policies aimed at protecting and managing heritage sites globally​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
Societal Awareness and Change: By highlighting the connections between heritage practices and future societal choices (e.g., what to preserve or discard), the study raises awareness about the social value of heritage and its role in shaping community identity. This can lead to changes in how societies engage with cultural heritage​(impact pathway).
3. Environmental Impact and Sustainability
Sustainability in Heritage Practices: The study's focus on long-term conservation, such as preservation efforts that extend for hundreds or even millions of years, highlights sustainability challenges in both cultural and natural contexts. The research promotes environmentally sustainable practices within heritage management​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Environmental Policy Influence: By incorporating waste management and resource conservation into heritage studies, the research has potential impacts on environmental policies related to resource use and sustainability in conservation practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Policy Influence
Shaping Public Policy: The research can inform heritage policies at local, national, and international levels. Its exploration of sustainability and long-term conservation practices may lead to the development of policies that integrate cultural and environmental concerns​(Research impact toolkit).
Global Policy Frameworks: The study’s international partnerships and focus on global issues suggest its findings could be used to support or shape international conservation agreements or standards, particularly those related to sustainable heritage management​(impact pathway).
5. Health and Well-being Impact
Indirect Public Health: By exploring how heritage practices (including managing waste or preserving natural spaces) influence environmental health, this research contributes to improving public well-being through sustainable land use and environmental conservation​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Technological and Innovation Impact
Innovation in Conservation Methods: The study introduces new ways to think about heritage, such as through the integration of waste management. This could inspire innovative technological solutions for conservation, particularly in how artifacts and environments are preserved or restored​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Economic Impact
Economic Opportunities in Heritage Management: The research opens up possibilities for new economic models in the heritage industry, including sustainable tourism, innovative conservation projects, and the creation of new markets around long-term preservation techniques​(Research impact toolkit).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Application: The study has potential applications in various global contexts, particularly where heritage and environmental conservation intersect. Its cross-disciplinary nature allows it to be applied across cultural, environmental, and public policy fields, influencing practices worldwide​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
9. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Challenging Conventional Heritage Practices: By rethinking traditional heritage practices and integrating waste management, the research disrupts the conventional focus on preservation, encouraging a broader and more holistic view of heritage that includes what is left behind as much as what is preserved​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Long-term Impact
Enduring Contributions to Cultural Preservation: The study’s focus on long-term conservation (up to a million years) emphasizes its potential for enduring impact on future generations. This long-term approach ensures that the study will influence conservation practices and policies well into the future​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
11. Ethical and Sustainability Considerations
Ethical Approaches to Heritage Conservation: The research promotes ethical heritage management by addressing the need to balance preservation with sustainability. This ensures that cultural conservation practices remain aligned with long-term environmental goals​(Common Research Impact …).
These impacts demonstrate the wide-ranging significance of the study, particularly in advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical application of heritage practices that account for sustainability, policy, and societal change.
