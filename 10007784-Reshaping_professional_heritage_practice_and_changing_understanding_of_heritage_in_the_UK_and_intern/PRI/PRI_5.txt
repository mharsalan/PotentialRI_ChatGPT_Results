Based on the study you provided and applying research impact dimensions, here are the most relevant potential research impacts, categorized by impact type:

1. Academic Impact
Contribution to Heritage and Climate Studies: The research contributes significantly to academic knowledge, particularly in the fields of cultural heritage conservation, environmental science, and climate change adaptation. It develops new frameworks for understanding how cultural and natural heritage sites are affected by climate change, providing scholars with new models for evaluating loss and preservation.
Development of Interdisciplinary Theories: By integrating heritage studies with environmental and social science, the research fosters interdisciplinary dialogue. This may result in the development of new theories that bridge the gap between cultural heritage and climate policy​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
2. Societal and Cultural Impact
Influence on Public Awareness of Heritage Loss: The study highlights how climate change threatens heritage sites, which can increase public awareness and generate support for climate action and heritage conservation. The idea of "curated decay" also opens up a societal debate on how we value cultural heritage in a changing environment.
Shaping Cultural Heritage Management: The concept of "relinquishment" and the acceptance of loss as generative challenge traditional views on preservation. This could lead to a shift in how heritage professionals, communities, and policymakers approach the inevitable loss of some heritage sites​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
3. Policy Impact
Informing Heritage and Environmental Policies: The study provides a foundation for new policy directions in heritage conservation, particularly in regions facing climate-related challenges. Policymakers may adopt more adaptive, realistic approaches to heritage management, focusing on resilience and selective conservation​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
Influencing International Conservation Agreements: By addressing how climate change impacts heritage, the research can inform international agreements such as UNESCO's cultural heritage conventions and climate adaptation frameworks. This could lead to global policy changes focused on the intersection of climate and heritage conservation​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
4. Environmental Impact
Sustainable Heritage Practices: The study emphasizes the need for sustainable management of heritage sites under climate pressures. It suggests that resources should be focused on adaptive strategies and sustainable preservation, reducing the environmental costs associated with traditional conservation methods​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
Climate Change Adaptation: The research highlights how heritage management can play a role in broader climate change adaptation strategies, influencing how environmental policies consider cultural assets when planning for climate resilience​(Common Research Impact …)​(impact pathway).
5. Economic Impact
Resource Allocation in Heritage Conservation: By proposing more pragmatic approaches to heritage loss, the research can lead to more cost-effective resource allocation. This could reduce the economic burden on governments and NGOs that invest heavily in conserving sites that may be unsustainable in the long term​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Technological and Methodological Impact
New Methods for Evaluating Heritage Loss: The study introduces innovative methodologies for assessing the value of heritage sites at risk of loss. These methods could be adopted globally by heritage managers and researchers to prioritize sites and resources more effectively​(Research Impact Knowled…)​(impact pathway).
7. Health and Well-being Impact
Cultural Identity and Mental Health: The loss of heritage sites can affect community identity and mental health, particularly in regions with deep cultural connections to their heritage. The study’s approach to managing loss with acceptance and adaptation could influence how societies handle the psychological and social impacts of such losses​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
8. Resilience and Adaptability
Enhancing Cultural and Environmental Resilience: By encouraging the acceptance of loss and the idea of "curated decay," the research fosters a resilient approach to cultural and environmental changes. Communities and policymakers may become more adaptable in their heritage management practices, focusing on resilience in the face of inevitable environmental challenges​(Common Research Impact …)​(Research impact toolkit).
9. Ethical and Sustainability Impact
Ethical Considerations in Resource Allocation: The research questions the ethics of investing heavily in unsustainable conservation efforts, advocating for a more equitable distribution of resources that considers future generations and global sustainability goals​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
10. Global Relevance and Cross-Disciplinary Impact
Applicability in Diverse Geographies: The concepts developed in the study, such as "relinquishment" and "curated decay," can be applied in a variety of global contexts, from small island states threatened by rising sea levels to urban heritage sites facing extreme weather events. This cross-disciplinary approach enhances the research’s relevance to global environmental and cultural policy debates​(impact pathway)​(Research impact toolkit).
These potential research impacts show how the study contributes broadly to academic fields, cultural heritage management, public policy, and environmental sustainability, with far-reaching effects across global and local contexts.
