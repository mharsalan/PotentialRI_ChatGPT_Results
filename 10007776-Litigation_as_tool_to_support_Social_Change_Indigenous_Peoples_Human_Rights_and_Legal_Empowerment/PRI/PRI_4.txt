Based on the comprehensive reading of the study and the various dimensions of research impact, here is an organized list of potential research impacts for the study. These are categorized based on different types of impact, as outlined in your uploaded materials and research documents.

1. Societal and Cultural Impact
Cultural Preservation and Heritage: The study significantly contributes to preserving indigenous cultural heritage through the documentation of traditional land-use practices. The mapping and documentation of territories are crucial in preserving not only the land but also the cultural and historical ties indigenous communities have with their environment​(impact pathway)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Social Justice and Equity: By supporting indigenous land claims, the study fosters social justice by helping marginalized communities regain legal rights over their ancestral lands. This can lead to greater equity, particularly in terms of access to land and resources, empowering traditionally underrepresented populations​(Research impact toolkit).
2. Environmental and Sustainability Impact
Environmental Conservation: The research contributes to environmental sustainability by supporting legal claims for the conservation of indigenous lands. These areas are often better preserved due to traditional land stewardship practices, thus supporting biodiversity and ecosystem conservation​(Research impact toolkit)​(Common Research Impact …).
Sustainable Land Use Practices: Through the documentation of traditional ecological knowledge, the study promotes sustainable land-use practices that are vital for both biodiversity preservation and climate resilience​(Research impact toolkit).
3. Policy Influence and Advocacy
Influencing Legal and Policy Frameworks: The research aids in changing or reinforcing legal frameworks regarding land ownership and indigenous rights. By providing documented evidence of land usage, it directly informs court decisions and governmental policies​(Research impact toolkit)​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Empowering Advocacy Efforts: The study bolsters the advocacy work of indigenous communities and NGOs, offering a practical tool to use in land-rights campaigns. It acts as a catalyst for legal reforms in favor of indigenous land rights​(impact pathway).
4. Academic and Knowledge Accumulation Impact
Contribution to Legal and Social Sciences: The study enriches academic fields such as legal studies, anthropology, and environmental science by providing new insights into the use of mapping and technology in legal processes involving indigenous claims​(Common Research Impact …).
Advancement of Participatory Research Methods: The research also advances participatory research methodologies, particularly in how indigenous communities can use technology (e.g., GPS mapping) to document their claims​(Research Impact Knowled…).
5. Economic and Technological Impact
Economic Empowerment: Successful land claims resulting from this research can lead to economic empowerment for indigenous communities by giving them control over land-based resources. This can improve their economic stability and contribute to community development​(Research impact toolkit).
Technological Adoption: The use of innovative mapping technologies for legal purposes represents a technological advancement that can be adopted in similar legal contexts globally, particularly in land tenure and environmental protection cases​(Research Impact Knowled…).
6. Health and Well-being Impact
Well-being of Indigenous Communities: By securing land rights, the study indirectly enhances the health and well-being of indigenous communities. Land ownership is closely tied to food security, traditional medicine, and social cohesion, all of which are crucial for overall community well-being​(Research impact toolkit).
7. Implementation and Usability Impact
Practical Tools for Legal Cases: The mapping tools and methodologies developed through this research are highly usable in real-world legal settings. Indigenous communities and their legal representatives can implement these tools in various court systems​(Common Research Impact …).
8. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Global Applicability: The research is not limited to a single country or region but has broader global relevance. It can be applied to indigenous land-rights cases worldwide, offering a framework for legal empowerment in different contexts​(Common Research Impact …).
Cross-disciplinary Insights: The study integrates knowledge from law, anthropology, environmental studies, and technology, creating a robust interdisciplinary approach to addressing complex societal issues​(impact pathway).
9. Ethical and Sustainability Considerations
Ethical Research Practices: The study adheres to ethical standards by ensuring that indigenous communities maintain control over their data and by respecting their cultural and environmental knowledge. This promotes ethical research practices in working with marginalized communities​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Long-term Sustainability: By documenting and advocating for sustainable land-use practices, the study contributes to long-term environmental sustainability. The knowledge it preserves helps ensure that these practices continue to be used by future generations​(Research impact toolkit).
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Resilience in Legal Advocacy: The research equips indigenous communities with resilient strategies for legal advocacy, adapting traditional knowledge into a form that can be recognized in modern legal systems​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Adaptability to Legal Systems: The tools and methods can be adapted to various legal systems worldwide, ensuring that indigenous claims can be addressed in both national and international courts​(impact pathway).
11. Public Awareness and Education
Raising Awareness on Indigenous Rights: By publishing findings and disseminating the tools developed, the research raises public awareness about indigenous land rights and the importance of cultural preservation​(Research Impact Knowled…).
Educational Tools for Future Generations: The documented knowledge serves as an educational resource for both indigenous youth and the broader public, preserving cultural traditions while educating others on the importance of land rights​(Research impact toolkit).
12. Capacity Building
Building Community Capacity: The study enhances the capacity of indigenous communities to document and legally protect their land rights, providing them with the tools and knowledge to engage with legal frameworks independently​(Research impact toolkit).
By contributing across a range of societal, environmental, legal, and technological domains, this study demonstrates significant potential for widespread and long-lasting impact across multiple dimensions of research impact.
