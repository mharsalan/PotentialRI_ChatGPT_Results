Based on the provided document and search results, here is a detailed assessment of the research impact across the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions for the attached study:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The research focuses on how indigenous peoples are using litigation as a tool for legal empowerment to seek remedies for human rights violations. This affects domains such as legal, social justice, and policy (1). Examples:
The study contributes to the Legal Domain by showcasing how indigenous communities use human rights litigation to address violations, pushing the legal system to recognize indigenous rights​(Knowledge - Potential R…). Additionally, it impacts the Social Domain by empowering communities to engage in legal processes, advancing their struggle for justice .
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts:

Litigation, while often seen as a last resort, has long-term implications by shaping the legal landscape for indigenous rights, affecting future generations and potentially inspiring shifts in legal policies globally . Examples:
The long-term impact lies in the continued use of legal strategies by indigenous communities, which has the potential to shift the relationship between indigenous peoples and state actors, laying the groundwork for enduring legal reforms and protections .
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts:

The primary stakeholders include indigenous communities, legal professionals, human rights advocates, and policymakers . Examples:
Indigenous peoples directly benefit from the research as it empowers them in legal battles, while legal professionals and policymakers gain insights into indigenous rights litigation, potentially influencing future policies at both national and international levels .
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts:

The research has deep impact within the field of indigenous legal rights, as it not only contributes to academic understanding but also transforms real-world practices of litigation. It offers broad implications across human rights advocacy and the fight for social justice globally . Examples:
Broad impact is seen in how the findings influence multiple countries' legal frameworks on indigenous rights, as highlighted by the cases in Belize, India, and Ecuador​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts:

The strategies discussed can be transferred and scaled globally, as litigation frameworks used in one region (e.g., Kenya or Paraguay) could inform legal strategies in other indigenous contexts worldwide . Examples:
A significant finding is that the approach to human rights litigation is not limited to one jurisdiction. It has the potential to be transferred across different legal systems, particularly those facing similar challenges related to indigenous rights .
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts:

The research highlights the innovative use of international human rights law within domestic legal frameworks, which disrupts traditional legal processes by placing indigenous rights at the forefront . Examples:
Disruptive potential is seen in how indigenous peoples are now using the courts—historically institutions of oppression—to achieve empowerment and justice. This represents a paradigm shift in the legal and political dynamics of indigenous-state relations .
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts:

The study promotes sustainable legal empowerment strategies that align with ethical standards of justice and fairness for marginalized indigenous communities​(Knowledge - Potential R…). Examples:
It encourages sustainable legal practices by advocating for long-term engagement in litigation that not only seeks immediate remedies but also paves the way for systemic changes in how indigenous rights are protected .
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts:

Litigation is portrayed not just as a legal strategy but as a tool for social empowerment. The research emphasizes how it must be part of a broader campaign to be effective . Examples:
Usability is evident in how indigenous communities are actively engaging in legal battles, using litigation as a practical tool to assert their rights. This participatory approach ensures that the research findings are implementable within real-world advocacy .
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts:

The research crosses boundaries between law, social justice, and human rights, addressing global challenges faced by indigenous communities, such as land rights and exploitation of natural resources . Examples:
Globally, the study is relevant to various disciplines, including legal studies, anthropology, and human rights activism. It addresses worldwide challenges such as land grabbing and the exploitation of indigenous peoples’ resources, which affect multiple nations .
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts:

Indigenous communities’ resilience is a key theme in this research, as they adapt to the use of litigation as a tool for justice despite adversarial and complex legal systems​(Knowledge - Potential R…). Examples:
The adaptability of indigenous legal strategies is seen in their shift from traditional forms of protest to the use of formal legal processes. This resilience is crucial in their fight against systemic injustice and encroachment .
