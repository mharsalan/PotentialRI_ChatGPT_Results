To assess the research paper across the Top 10 Dimensions of Research Impact based on the document you provided, I have extracted information and mapped it against the relevant dimensions:

1. Domains of Research Impact
Excerpts: "The strong law and policy framework for the preservation and promotion of culture immensely benefits indigenous peoples, as they usually have a strong attachment to their unique and rich cultures and traditions. However, the lack of secure land tenure presents a major challenge to the protection and transmission of indigenous cultures" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: The research impacts both legal and cultural domains by highlighting how law influences cultural preservation, specifically for indigenous peoples, linking land rights to the preservation of culture.

2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Since independence in 1963, there has been no legal framework for the recognition for indigenous peoples’ communal land rights in Kenya" (Discussion, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Discussion, p. 207​(3).

Example: This research highlights long-term issues, indicating how lack of legal recognition has enduring consequences on indigenous cultures, which suggests the research could have lasting influence in changing legal policies for indigenous land rights.

3. Stakeholders of Research Impact
Excerpts: "Indigenous communities have often had recourse to litigation to pursue the recognition and protection of their land and natural resource rights as both a direct and indirect means of protecting their cultures" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: Stakeholders include indigenous peoples, legal professionals, and policymakers. This research directly supports indigenous groups seeking legal recognition and protection of their cultural and land rights.

4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: "The recognition of indigenous peoples and the protection of their traditional lands and resources is a critical component for the promotion and protection of their cultures" (Discussion, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Discussion, p. 207​(3).

Example: The depth of impact is specific to indigenous land rights, while the breadth extends to legal reforms and cultural preservation at national and potentially international levels.

5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "In recent years, courts all over the world have diverged from and evolved a number of exceptions to the traditional view of locus standi" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: The transferability is evident as legal precedents in one region may influence global human rights litigation strategies, particularly for indigenous land and cultural rights.

6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "The public interest that is driving the acquisition of indigenous peoples’ territories for national development priorities like conservation, carbon, agriculture and other infrastructure projects also threatens indigenous land rights and by extension their cultures" (Results, p. 213)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 213​(3).

Example: The disruption potential is high as this research could challenge current national development models by integrating the preservation of indigenous rights into broader policies on land use and conservation.

7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "The government deliberately delayed the enactment of a Community Land Act beyond the time provided by the constitution" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: Ethical considerations include addressing historical marginalization and ensuring that legal processes promote sustainability by safeguarding indigenous cultural rights alongside national development interests.

8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "The constitution mandates the state to protect indigenous cultures, but the absence of a clear legal framework has hindered effective implementation" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: Usability is currently limited by the absence of implementation frameworks, but the research provides clear recommendations for policy and legal reforms to promote indigenous land rights and cultural preservation.

9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The lack of secure land tenure presents a major challenge to the protection and transmission of indigenous cultures" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: Cross-disciplinary relevance includes intersections between law, human rights, and cultural studies, with global implications for how land tenure is linked to cultural preservation across different nations.

10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "Emerging jurisprudence on locus standi therefore avails greater opportunities for litigating indigenous cultural rights attached to land by indigenous peoples themselves and other parties interested in protecting indigenous peoples’ rights" (Results, p. 207)​(3).

Page Reference and Section: Results, p. 207​(3).

Example: Resilience is shown through the legal adaptability in evolving court decisions that protect indigenous rights, demonstrating how research on legal frameworks can continue to evolve and remain relevant.
