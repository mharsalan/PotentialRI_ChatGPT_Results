Based on the text you have provided from both the study and the knowledge document on research impact dimensions, I can now analyze the study's contribution across the Top 10 Research Impact Dimensions as follows:

1. Domains of Research Impact:
Excerpts: The study engages with indigenous land rights, specifically focusing on how communities can use mapping for cultural preservation and legal purposes. It supports environmental, legal, and social domains by mapping traditional land use to fight legal battles over land ownership (e.g., the Batwa case in Uganda).
Page Reference: Results, page 10.
Example: The research impacts the legal domain by providing indigenous communities with tools for evidence collection in litigation processes, the environmental domain by documenting land use and contributing to conservation, and the social domain by fostering cultural preservation and intergenerational knowledge transfer.
2. Duration of Research Impact:
Excerpts: The study highlights both short-term and long-term impacts. Short-term, it influences immediate court cases and legal empowerment. Long-term, it contributes to the preservation of indigenous cultures and land use practices for future generations.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 12.
Example: Short-term impact involves using mapping data in court cases to support indigenous land rights claims. Long-term impact includes contributing to cultural preservation, ensuring future generations are empowered through documented traditions and land-use patterns​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
3. Stakeholders of Research Impact:
Excerpts: Stakeholders include indigenous communities, courts, NGOs, and future generations. The study empowers indigenous people and impacts legal systems by influencing court decisions on land rights.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 11.
Example: Direct stakeholders include indigenous groups using mapping for land claims. Indirect stakeholders are future generations who benefit from the preservation of traditional knowledge and land use practices​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact:
Excerpts: The study has a deep impact in the field of indigenous land rights by transforming how evidence is gathered and used in legal battles. It also has broad implications as it can be applied in various legal systems worldwide and influence policy across regions.
Page Reference: Results, page 11.
Example: Deep impact is seen in the legal empowerment of indigenous communities. Broad impact occurs as the methodologies developed could be adapted to other legal systems globally​(Knowledge - Potential R…) .
5. Scalability and Transferability:
Excerpts: The mapping methodologies developed can be scaled up for use across different indigenous groups globally. The technology and participatory processes are transferable to other legal contexts and environmental conservation efforts.
Page Reference: Methods, page 10.
Example: The mapping techniques can be scaled to larger platforms like the LandMark Map project, and transferred to other sectors such as environmental conservation and policy reform in other regions​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential:
Excerpts: The research introduces innovative approaches to mapping and evidence gathering for indigenous land rights. It disrupts traditional legal approaches by integrating indigenous perspectives and participatory methods into formal legal processes.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 12.
Example: This research is innovative in using modern technology (GPS, digital maps) to support traditional land claims and has disruptive potential as it challenges the dominant legal frameworks by validating indigenous land-use evidence​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations:
Excerpts: The research promotes sustainability by preserving cultural heritage and promoting land conservation through legal recognition of indigenous territories. It aligns with ethical considerations by ensuring that indigenous communities maintain control over their data and cultural knowledge.
Page Reference: Methods, page 11.
Example: The study promotes environmental sustainability by supporting land conservation, and it addresses ethical concerns by respecting the autonomy of indigenous communities in data collection and legal advocacy​(Knowledge - Potential R…)​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
8. Implementation and Usability:
Excerpts: The study provides practical tools for communities to engage with mapping technologies and use them in legal proceedings, ensuring usability in real-world legal and environmental advocacy contexts.
Page Reference: Results, page 10.
Example: The mapping tools developed are highly usable for indigenous communities in court proceedings and land management efforts​(4) .
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance:
Excerpts: The research is interdisciplinary, combining legal studies, environmental conservation, and indigenous cultural studies. It is relevant globally, as it provides a model for indigenous land rights that can be applied in different countries.
Page Reference: Results, page 11.
Example: The research on indigenous land rights has global relevance, as seen in its applications from Uganda to Malaysia, making it applicable in different countries fighting for land conservation and indigenous rights​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
10. Resilience and Adaptability:
Excerpts: The research demonstrates resilience by adapting traditional land use practices into modern legal contexts. It shows adaptability as indigenous communities use the mapping tools to strengthen their land claims in ever-changing legal environments.
Page Reference: Discussion, page 12.
Example: Indigenous communities show resilience by integrating modern mapping techniques into their legal strategies and adaptability by evolving their traditional practices to meet legal evidentiary standards​(Knowledge - Potential R…).
This comprehensive analysis highlights the multifaceted impact of the study across key dimensions of research impact.
