
Here is a detailed research impact assessment of the attached study on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Tinnitus (MBCT-t) across the top 10 dimensions of research impact:

1. Domains of Research Impact (RI)
Excerpts: The study significantly contributes to the healthcare domain by demonstrating MBCT-t's efficacy in reducing tinnitus distress and improving psychological health and quality of life. "This evaluation indicates that there is value in developing research to explore long-term outcomes of MBCT-t" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Results, pages 13-16 .
Example: The research supports healthcare providers by offering evidence that MBCT-t can reduce repeated healthcare visits and improve patient well-being.
2. Duration of Research Impact
Excerpts: "A large proportion (70-80 per cent) of the 66 people...reported that their initial benefits from MBCT-t...were either sustained or even improved in the years following treatment completion" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Conclusions, page 16 .
Example: The research provides evidence of MBCT-t’s long-term benefits, showing sustained improvements in tinnitus management and well-being for over five years, indicating significant long-term healthcare impact.
3. Stakeholder of Research Impact
Excerpts: Stakeholders include healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers. "MBCT-t could represent a way out of this pattern of repeated healthcare use for more people seeking help for this problem, with significant economic and health implications" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 16 .
Example: Healthcare professionals benefit directly by adopting MBCT-t as a treatment option, reducing patient distress, and improving clinical outcomes, while the general public gains from better access to effective treatments.
4. Depth and Breadth of Impact
Excerpts: MBCT-t demonstrates deep impact by changing patient responses to tinnitus through cognitive and mindfulness-based techniques, leading to less anxiety and improved quality of life. "Respondents described more general improvements in their wellbeing, reporting reduced levels of anxiety and depression" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Results, page 16 .
Example: The deep impact is seen in healthcare where MBCT-t alters the therapeutic approach to chronic tinnitus, while broad impact extends into psychological therapies for other chronic conditions.
5. Scalability and Transferability
Excerpts: "MBCT-t could be scaled to other chronic conditions with similar distressing symptoms...such as chronic pain" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 16 .
Example: The study offers a scalable approach for broader healthcare applications, allowing MBCT-t to be applied to various chronic conditions beyond tinnitus, enhancing its overall transferability to other healthcare domains.
6. Innovation and Disruption Potential
Excerpts: "MBCT-t introduces a new therapeutic approach for chronic tinnitus, reducing reliance on pharmaceutical and surgical interventions" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Conclusions, page 16 .
Example: The research disrupts traditional tinnitus management by providing an innovative, non-invasive treatment option that reduces the need for recurring healthcare services.
7. Sustainability and Ethical Considerations
Excerpts: "MBCT-t’s ability to reduce healthcare usage represents a sustainable solution for managing chronic conditions" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Conclusions, page 16 .
Example: The sustainability impact lies in the reduction of healthcare costs and long-term management of tinnitus without relying on medication or surgery, aligning with ethical considerations in promoting patient well-being.
8. Implementation and Usability
Excerpts: "High completion rates (90 per cent) indicate the usability of MBCT-t within clinical settings" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Methods, page 15 .
Example: MBCT-t’s ease of implementation in clinical settings is evidenced by high patient retention and completion rates, suggesting strong usability for wider clinical adoption.
9. Cross-disciplinary and Global Relevance
Excerpts: "The holistic benefits of MBCT-t, including improvements in psychological and physical well-being, indicate its relevance across multiple healthcare and psychological domains" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Results, page 16 .
Example: The cross-disciplinary impact of MBCT-t spans mental health and audiology, while its global relevance is underscored by the universality of tinnitus as a common condition affecting millions worldwide.
10. Resilience and Adaptability
Excerpts: "MBCT-t teaches skills that patients can continue to use beyond therapy, indicating its adaptability for long-term self-management" (Clinical Evaluation).
Page Reference: Discussion, page 16 .
Example: The adaptability of MBCT-t is seen in patients’ ability to integrate mindfulness techniques into daily life, promoting long-term resilience in managing chronic tinnitus and similar conditions.
This detailed analysis reflects how MBCT-t research contributes to diverse domains and highlights its broad and deep impacts across healthcare and psychological disciplines.
